    "This article focuses on the effects of urbanization and economic development on carbon dioxide (CO2)\n",
    "emissions in non-high income countries using the extended STIRPAT model. Following the building idea\n",
    "of the IPAT model, CO2 emissions (I) are decomposed into nine factors: population, afﬂuence, technology\n",
    "level, urbanization level, urban employment level, industrialization level, population carrying intensity of\n",
    "the real economy built on goods and services, CO2 emission intensity and energy intensity. Then the\n",
    "extended IPAT model is reconstructed as the extended STIRPAT model. Furthermore, based on panel data\n",
    "from 1991 to 2013 and using the extended STIRPAT model, this article respectively analyzes the effects of\n",
    "the driving forces, especially urbanization and real economic development, on CO2 emissions for nonhigh income countries, upper and lower middle-income countries. The results indicate that urbanization and real economic development have a small impact on CO2 emissions in non-high income countries. Accelerating urbanization and real economic development will not result in a signiﬁcant increase in\n",
    "CO2 emissions. In fact, for upper middle-income countries, real economic development will lead to a\n",
    "decrease in CO2 emissions, and acceleration of the urbanization process will only cause a small increase\n",
    "in emissions. The main driving factors of CO2 emissions remain population, afﬂuence, energy intensity\n",
    "and CO2 emission intensity. This article also quantitatively calculates the actual contribution rate of each\n",

    "The “greenhouse effect” was ﬁrst identiﬁed by the Swedish\n",
    "scientist Svante Ahrrenius in 1896. There is now a global consensus\n",
    "that the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) leads\n",
    "to climate warming. According to IPCC (2014), the warming of the\n",
    "climate system is unequivocal, and many of the observed changes\n",
    "since the 1950s are unprecedented throughout previous decades to\n",
    "millennia. Human inﬂuence on the climate system is clear, and the\n",
    "current anthropogenic emissions of GHG are the highest in history.\n",
    "The greenhouse effect is attributed largely to carbon emissions as\n",

    "(IEA, 2012). According to statistical data from the World Bank\n",
    "(2016), the share of CO2 in all greenhouse gases emissions has\n",
    "been gradually increasing, from 54.63% in 1970 to 67.21% in 2012.\n",
    "The CO2 emissions grew by 2.08% per annum in the period from\n",
    "1970 to 2013 and reached 35.84 billion tonnes in 2013, which is\n",
    "2.42 times their 1970 level (World Bank, 2016). Consequently, how\n",

    "increasing attention.\n",
    "The history of developed countries shows that economic growth\n",
    "is a process of urbanization and industrialization which makes\n",
    "people move from rural to urban areas and from agricultural to\n",
    "industrial employment. Many non-high income countries are\n",
    "making efforts to accelerate their industrialization and urbanization. The global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 however exposed the\n",

    "dangers of the ﬁctitious economy associated with ﬁnancial transactions involving ﬁctitious capital, such as property rights and the\n",
    "stock exchange.1 It also emphasized the importance of the real\n",
    "economy built on goods and services, including industrialization.\n",
    "Policies encouraging structural reforms aimed at the industrial\n",
    "sector, including manufacturing industries, were put in place. For\n",
    "example, USA introduced a Reindustrialization Strategy (Wu, 2016)\n",
    "while Germany proposed Industry 4.0 (Kagermann ‘., 2013).\n",
    "China is currently implementing a new type urbanization and\n",
    "transformation of its manufacturing through the program entitled\n",
    "“Made in China (2025)” (Kennedy, 2015).\n",
    "Industry is the core sector of the real economy which Wu (2004)\n",
    "measured using the industrial value-added. Similarly, this study\n",
    "also measures the development of the real economy with the level\n",
    "of industrialization (i.e. share of industrial value-added in GDP) and\n",
    "the population carrying intensity of the real economy (i.e. total\n",
    "population divided by industrial value-added).\n",
    "Most previous research indicates that urbanization and industrialization increase energy consumption and carbon emissions\n",
    "(Shuai ‘., 2017), but there are also some empirical studies which\n",
    "ﬁnd a negative relationship. Dodman (2009) argued that there was\n",
    "no fundamental link between urbanization and high GHG emissions level; on the contrary, well-planned, well-managed cities\n",
    "could play a central role in helping to mitigate against climate\n",
    "change. Zhang ‘. (2016) found a negative impact of urbanization\n",
    "level on the air pollution index in China during 2003e2010.\n",
    "Furthermore, Poumanyvong and Kaneko (2010) indicated that the\n",
    "impacts of urbanization on emissions vary across different stages of\n",
    "development. For 1990e2012, Zhou and Liu (2016) similarly found\n",
    "different impacts of the levels of urbanization and industrialization\n",
    "on energy-related CO2 emissions across Chinese regions which are\n",
    "at different stages of development.\n",
    "Urbanization is usually represented by the proportion of urban\n",
    "to total population, such as in the studies by Fan ‘. (2006), Lin\n",
    "‘. (2009), Liddle and Lung (2010) and Zhou ‘. (2011). This\n",
    "is obviously a very blunt measure, requiring more careful examination. For example, millions of rural residents have migrated to\n",
    "the cities in China since the country's opening-up and reform in the\n",
    "late 1970s. However, they have far worse employment opportunities and welfare coverage, compared to the original urban residents (Ye and Wu, 2014) making the urbanization process uneven.\n",
    "Ye and Wu (2014) point out that China's urbanization is characterized by underurbanization of the population and fast expansion\n",
    "of the urban land. Such an incomplete urbanization lacks efﬁciency\n",
    "and is full of risks. Hence the employment and wealth creation\n",
    "mechanism are important to improve the quality of urbanization.\n",
    "Therefore, in addition to percentage urban population, urban\n",
    "employment level is introduced in this study to measure the quality\n",
    "of urbanization, particularly relevant to non-high income countries\n",
    "which are still developing their economies. This allows for urbanization and its effects on CO2 emissions to be analysed in a more\n",
    "comprehensive way. Similarly, it is not sufﬁcient to simply measure\n",
    "industrialization as the share of industrial value-added in GDP. The\n",
    "population carrying intensity of the real economy is introduced to\n",
    "measure the impact of the real economy on the environment. We\n",
    "expect that the bigger the value of the population carrying intensity\n",
    "of the real economy, the more people this economy carries and the\n",

    "The ﬁctitious economy includes all activities involving ﬁctitious capital, mainly\n",
    "based on ﬁnancial platforms (Cheng, 2003, 2008), such as the transferable titles in\n",
    "property rights and the stock exchange (Bhaduri ‘., 2006). Contrary to the\n",
    "ﬁctitious economy, the real economy represents the material activities which\n",
    "produce goods and services (Bhaduri ‘., 2006). The real economy is the basis for\n",
    "the existence and development of the ﬁctitious economy, while the ﬁctitious\n",

    "greater the impact on resources and the environment it produces.\n",
    "These variables are introduced through extending the IPAT and\n",
    "STIRPAT models, rather than arbitrarily adding them to the model.\n",
    "The new variables are conceptually appropriate for the multiplicative speciﬁcation of the model and can be added to the basic\n",
    "STIRPAT model.\n",
    "According to Dietz and Rosa (1997), the nation-state is the\n",
    "principal collective actor in generating environmental impacts and\n",
    "in developing policies in response to them. Non-high income\n",
    "countries at a different stage of development, including upper\n",
    "middle-income and lower middle-income countries, can vary in\n",
    "their impacts on the environment, including determinants of CO2\n",
    "emissions, as well as policy responses (Sharma, 2011). Therefore, it\n",
    "is interesting to not only analyse the changes across the non-high\n",
    "income economies but also distinguish between different categories of countries.\n",
    "In view of the above, we analyse the driving factors of CO2\n",
    "emissions for 53 non-high income countries, 31 upper middle- and\n",
    "17 lower middle-income countries using the extended STIRPAT\n",
    "model, to understand the impacts of urbanization and real economic development.\n",
    "A contribution of this study is to decompose I (CO2 emissions)\n",
    "according to the traditional IPAT and then STIRPAT model, so that all\n",
    "variables in the extended version are conceptually appropriate for\n",
    "the multiplicative speciﬁcation of the model. This is clearly\n",
    "different from previous studies. Another contribution is the use of\n",
    "urbanization level and urban employment level to measure urbanization, and industrialization level and the population carrying\n",
    "intensity of the real economy to measure the real economic\n",
    "development. These indicators better reﬂect the urbanization and\n",
    "real economic development of non-high income countries. They\n",
    "allow the impacts of urbanization and real economic development\n",
    "on CO2 emissions to be better examined.\n",
    "2. Literature review\n",
    "As a global issue, CO2 and generally greenhouse gas (GHG)\n",
    "emissions have been studied extensively from different perspectives. There have been a lot of progresses made in understanding\n",
    "the driving factors of CO2 emissions. The STIRPAT model, proposed\n",
    "by Dietz and Rosa (1994) as an improvement of the IPAT model, is\n",
    "one of the most popular measures used in studies about the impact\n",
    "of anthropogenic factors on GHG and other contaminating emissions, such as CO2 emissions. According to its developers: “The\n",
    "foundation of STIRPAT is an orienting perspective that combines\n",
    "insights from human ecology with a version of environmental sociology that insists on examining a combination of physical, biological, and social variables in combination” (Rosa ‘., 2004, p. 1).\n",
    "This model has been constantly reﬁned and applied while simultaneously used for empirical analysis and policy recommendations.\n",
    "The list of studies includes York ‘. (2003), Shi (2003), Fan ‘.\n",
    "(2006), Martínez-Zarzoso ‘. (2007), Martínez-Zarzoso and\n",
    "Maruotti (2011), Tian and Da Costa (2014), Li and Lin (2015) and\n",
    "Lin ‘. (2016). They used the STIRPAT model mainly to analyse the\n",
    "driving forces of CO2 emissions across countries, usually focusing\n",
    "on traditional factors such as population, afﬂuence, urbanization\n",
    "and industrialization. For example, Shi (2003) assessed the impact\n",
    "of population change on CO2 emissions based on a pooled crosscountry data over the 1975e1996 period. Martínez-Zarzoso and\n",
    "Maruotti (2011) analysed the impact of urbanization on CO2\n",
    "emissions in developing countries during 1975e2003. Fan ‘.\n",
    "(2006) employed the STIRPAT model to analyse the impact of\n",
    "population, afﬂuence, technology, urbanization level and population aged 15e64 on the CO2 emissions of countries at different\n",
    "income levels for 1975e2000. Li and Lin (2015) examined the\n",

    "impacts of urbanization and industrialization on energy consumption and CO2 emissions with a balanced panel data set for 73\n",
    "countries over the 1971e2010 period. Shuai ‘. (2017) investigated the impacts of population, afﬂuence and technology on CO2\n",
    "emissions of 125 countries during 1990e2011 using the STIRPAT\n",
    "model with panel and time-series data.\n",
    "With China being the largest CO2 emitter in the world, an\n",
    "increasing number of studies have analysed the driving forces of CO2\n",
    "and GHG emissions in this country applying the STIRPAT model (for\n",
    "example, Li ‘., 2011; Shao ‘., 2011; Wang ‘., 2011; Wang\n",
    "‘., 2012, 2013; Zhang and Lin, 2012; Song ‘., 2014; Ding ‘.,\n",
    "2015; Wang and Zhao, 2015; and Wen and Liu, 2016a; 2016b).\n",
    "Furthermore, some studies have also analysed the determinants of\n",
    "environmental impact, energy consumption, ecological footprint,\n",
    "water footprint, and cement consumption through the STIRPAT\n",
    "model (e.g. Lin ‘., 2009; Wang ‘., 2010; Zhao ‘., 2014; Cao\n",
    "‘., 2016; Zhang ‘., 2016; Ren ‘., 2016; Zhou and Liu, 2016).\n",
    "More explanation about the methodological aspects of the STIRPAT\n",
    "model is provided in Li and Lin (2015) and Uddin ‘. (2013).\n",
    "The STIRPAT model has been widely applied to assess the driving\n",
    "factors of CO2 emissions or environmental impact, but as Uddin\n",
    "‘. (2013) indicate, most STIRPAT researchers use the econometric framework as a starting point, and then specify models on\n",
    "different scales by simply adding or dropping variables. Although\n",
    "York ‘. (2003) indicate factors in addition to the original P, A and\n",
    "T can be added to the basic STIRPAT model so long as they are\n",
    "conceptually appropriate for its multiplicative speciﬁcation, many\n",
    "have added other forces that might not satisfy this requirement. For\n",
    "example, Zhang ‘. (2016) added urbanization level, industrialization level, green coverage level, environmental pollution control\n",
    "investment, and environmental protection technology indicated by\n",
    "year dummy into the STIRPAT model to examine the effects on the\n",
    "air pollution index; however they did not explicitly clarify whether\n",
    "these variables were conceptually compatible with the model.\n",
    "Similarly, Zhao ‘. (2014) included diet structure change\n",
    "measured by the proportion of calories from meat products and\n",
    "urbanization level to analyse the inﬂuence on water footprint\n",
    "change, without considering conceptual compatibility with the\n",
    "model. Ren ‘. (2016) introduced environmental regulation as a\n",
    "key independent variable, in addition to urbanization rate, afﬂuence degree, energy intensity and industrial structure, to examine\n",
    "the effects on ecological efﬁciency. Other similar studies include\n",
    "among others Wang ‘. (2012), Zhang and Lin (2012), Shaﬁei and\n",
    "Salim (2014), Song ‘. (2014), Lin ‘. (2016), Wang ‘. (2016)\n",
    "and Wen and Liu (2016a, 2016b). The lack of a uniﬁed standard and\n",
    "theoretical guidance in selecting variables combined with arbitrarily adding or removing of variables is likely to reduce the\n",
    "credibility and robustness of the research in this area. Even for the\n",
    "same research object, the results might show a large deviation due\n",
    "to the use of different variables.\n",
    "Therefore, this article argues that additional variables should\n",
    "not be arbitrarily added in the model but should be conceptually\n",
    "appropriate for its multiplicative speciﬁcation. In view of this, the\n",
    "current study attempts to decompose I (environmental impact) into\n",
    "factors based on the simple, systematic and robust IPAT model\n",
    "(Dietz and Rosa, 1997). The resulting factors are introduced as\n",
    "additional variables to expand the STIRPAT model. This can eliminate the arbitrariness in variable selection and in theory obtain\n",
    "more credible variables. An overview of the various driving forces\n",
    "or variables used in the study for the STIRPAT model is presented in\n",
    "Table 1.\n",
    "3. Extended IPAT model and STIRPAT model\n",
    "Ehrlich and Holdren (1971) ﬁrstly used the I¼PAT formulation to\n",
    "\n",
    "assess the impact of the Earth's growing population on the environment. The principal idea is that the total environmental impacts\n",
    "(I) are a multiplicative function of population size (P), afﬂuence (A)\n",
    "described as per capita consumption or production, and the level of\n",
    "environmental damage caused by technology per unit of consumption or production (T) (Lin ‘., 2009). Subsequently, some\n",
    "studies added other factors from different perspectives to expand\n",
    "the IPAT model, proposing the ImPACT (Waggoner and Ausubel,\n",
    "2002), ImPACTS (Xu ‘., 2005) and IPBAT (Schulze, 2002)\n",
    "models. However, they all assume that the elasticity of environmental impact with respect to P, A, T and other determinants is only\n",
    "one respectively. It means that each driving factor is equally\n",
    "important for the environmental impact in the model. To overcome\n",
    "this pivotal limitation, Dietz and Rosa (1994) proposed the STIRPAT\n",
    "(Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Afﬂuence and\n",
    "Technology) model, which is the stochastic form of IPAT. The\n",
    "standard STIRPAT model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ii ¼ aPib Aci Tid ei\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking logarithms, the model becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "ln Iit ¼ a þ bðln Pit Þ þ cðln Ait Þ þ dðln Tit Þ þ ln ei\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "where the subscript i denotes the observational units; t - the year;\n",
    "b, c, and d are respectively the coefﬁcients of P, A, and T; e is the\n",
    "error term, and a is the constant.\n",
    "Then the model can analyse non-proportionate impacts of variables on the environment while the multiplicative logic of equation I¼PAT is still preserved. As already noted, York ‘. (2003)\n",
    "pointed out that additional factors can be added to the basic\n",
    "STIRPAT model so long as they are conceptually appropriate for its\n",
    "multiplicative speciﬁcation.\n",
    "In the IPAT model, I is decomposed into three variables, namely\n",
    "P, A and T. Then we can follow this idea to decompose CO2 emissions into more variables in addition to P, A and T, as follows:\n",

    "the urban employment level is. As between 1991 and 2013 urban\n",
    "population, i.e. the denominator of this indicator, increased faster\n",
    "due to rapid urbanization, than the employed population, i.e. the\n",
    "numerator, the value of this indicator decreased rapidly (as shown\n",
    "in Fig. 4). Moreover, the urban employment level in the upper\n",
    "middle-income countries should be relatively higher than that in\n",
    "lower middle-income countries, but the value of this indicator is\n",
    "lower (shown in Figs. 4 and 5). We can also see in Fig. 6 that the\n",

    "The improvement of urbanization quality lies in the employment and wealth creation mechanism. Hence, the urban employment level, as an important indicator reﬂecting urbanization\n",

    "4.1. Data source\n",
    "The data for all variables are obtained from the World Bank's\n",
    "World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2016). The GDP per\n",
    "capita is in constant prices (namely 2011 US dollars), allowing\n",
    "comparisons across nations and over time.\n",
    "4.2. Data description\n",
    "Table 2 describes all variables for each type of countries in 2013.\n",
    "It shows four characteristics as follows. Firstly, the population of the\n",
    "upper middle-income countries is almost the same as that of the\n",
    "lower middle-income countries, while their CO2 emissions are 4.39\n",
    "times that of the latter. Secondly, the urbanization level, urban\n",
    "employment level, afﬂuence and technological level of the upper\n",
    "middle-income countries are much higher than those of the lower\n",
    "middle-income countries. Thirdly, the industrialization level of the\n",
    "upper middle-income countries is only slightly higher than that of\n",
    "the lower middle-income countries, while the population carrying\n",
    "intensity of the real economy is much lower than that of the latter.\n",
    "This indicates that the lower middle-income countries are facing\n",
    "\n",
    "greater population carrying pressures. Fourthly, the CO2 emission\n",
    "intensity and the energy intensity are close for both types of\n",
    "countries.\n",
    "Figs. 1e10 describe the changes in the variables according to the\n",
    "original data (without logarithmic transformation) for each type of\n",
    "countries over the period 1991e2013. They show that:\n",
    "1. The CO2 emissions of the upper middle-income countries are\n",
    "much larger, accounting for about 80% of that of all non-high\n",
    "income countries. They also increased faster, with an average\n",
    "annual growth rate of 3.80%, compared to only 3.29% for the\n",
    "lower middle-income countries.\n",
    "2. The population of the lower middle-income countries grew\n",
    "faster, with an average annual growth rate of 1.62%, and this is\n",
    "narrowing the gap with the upper middle-income countries,\n",
    "which grew 0.88% per annum.\n",
    "3. GDP per capita of the lower middle-income countries was much\n",
    "lower but increased faster. Its average annual growth rate is\n",
    "2.59%, which is 0.54% higher than that of the upper middleincome countries. Similarly, the labor productivity of the\n",
    "lower middle-income countries was much lower, but also\n",
    "increased faster. Their average annual growth rate is 0.17%\n",
    "higher than that of the upper middle-income countries.\n",
    "4. In the 1991e2013 period, the urbanization levels of both types\n",
    "of countries increased rapidly. The urbanization levels of the\n",
    "upper middle-income countries continued to be about 15%\n",
    "higher than that of the lower middle-income countries. For both\n",
    "types of countries, the urban employment levels also increased\n",
    "rapidly, and the gap between them shrank fast.\n",
    "5. From 1991 to 2013, the industrialization level of the lower\n",
    "middle-income countries was always higher than that of the\n",
    "upper middle-income countries and the gap gradually narrowed\n",
    "to about 1.7%. The population carrying intensity of the real\n",
    "economy of the lower middle-income countries was much\n",
    "bigger and increased faster than that of the upper middleincome countries. For the former, the average annual growth\n",
    "rate is 1.77%, while it is 1.18% for the latter.\n",

    "Based on the extended STIRPAT model and using panel data\n",
    "covering 53 non-high income countries over the period 1991e2013,\n",
    "this article analysed the driving forces of CO2 emissions with\n",
    "consideration of national differences. The sample countries were\n",
    "divided into two categories, namely lower and upper middleincome economies.\n",
    "The results show that urbanization and the development of real\n",
    "economy have weak impacts on CO2 emissions in non-high income\n",
    "countries. They would not result in a large increase of CO2 emissions even if the countries vigorously promote urbanization and the\n",
    "development of real economy. For the upper middle-income\n",
    "countries, the development of real economy will even result in a\n",
    "reduction in CO2 emissions. The main driving forces of CO2 emissions are increase in population, GDP per capita and CO2 emission\n",
    "intensity, while the main causes of CO2 emissions decrease are\n",
    "improvement of technological level and rapid reduction in energy\n",
    "intensity. Regardless of the income country category, the energy\n",
    "intensity decreased very rapidly, approximately 2% per annum in\n",
    "the period 1991e2013. It greatly restrained the increase of CO2\n",
    "emissions, with the contribution degree of 51.07% for all non-high\n",
    "income countries, 46.96% for upper middle-income countries and\n",
    "66.64% for lower middle-income countries.\n",
    "These ﬁndings are of interest to policy makers as they outline\n",
    "different development patterns and opportunities. Non-high income countries, regardless of whether they are lower or upper\n",
    "middle-income economies, need to monitor population and GDP\n",
    "per capita changes, effectively improve technological level and\n",
    "reduce energy intensity and CO2 emission intensity, in order to\n",
    "restrain CO2 emissions increases. At the same time, they should\n",
    "explore connotative development and improving the quality of\n",
    "urbanization and real economy rather than only scale.\n",
    "At present, the most important and primary task for non-high\n",
    "income countries is to achieve economic and social development,\n",
    "including elimination of poverty. In the future non-high income\n",
    "countries are highly likely to continue to stimulate economic\n",
    "growth and accelerate industrialization and urbanization. It is\n",
    "impossible to restrict this in order to control CO2 emissions. This is\n",
    "why non-high income countries since the 2002 World Summit on\n",
    "Sustainable Development in Johannesburg have been insisting on\n",
    "the use of the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CISDL, 2002). An optional solution is for the developed countries to take more responsibility and provide more\n",
    "technological and ﬁnancial assistance to non-high income countries to help improve their technology and efﬁciency. This will\n",
    "allow these countries to further improve their ability to protect the\n",
    "environment and restrain greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, total\n",
    "emissions would be restrained effectively by joint efforts from all\n",
    "countries. However, although some steps might be under way\n",
    "through a global green orientation of the world's economies\n",
    "(Marinova ‘., 2013), it is very difﬁcult to achieve an effective\n",
    "coordination. When well-informed and well-intended, each country can make an effort to combat and reduce the effects of climate\n",
    "change on its own economy as well as on the planet.\n",
    "This study provides interesting ﬁndings and policy implications,\n",
    "but it also has some limitations. One limitation is that it only estimated the model based on the panel data for the period\n",
    "1991e2013. Future studies could be based on longer data sets, such\n",

    "965\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future studies other variables could be added to measure\n",

    "the real economic development, such as manufacturing added\n",
    "value and manufacturing production index. Certainly, these variables added in the model should be conceptually appropriate for\n",
    "the multiplicative speciﬁcation of the STIRPAT model. Finally, future\n",

    "of 125 countries at different income levels over the period of 1990-2011. The results show that the key\n",
    "impact factor (KIF) at global level is affluence, followed by technology and population in the order of their\n",
    "impacts on carbon emission. For countries at high-income (HI) level, technology has the greatest impact\n",
    "on carbon emission, while affluence has the least. Affluence, prior to technology and population, is\n",
    "identified as the KIF of carbon emission for countries at upper-middle-income (UMI) and lower-\n",
    "middle-income (LMI) levels. When it comes to the low-income (LI) level, affluence serves as the factor\n",
    "greatest affecting on carbon emission, and technology has the least impact. In particular, two generic pat-\n",
    "terns are identified based on the empirical results: higher income leads to greater impact of the technol-\n",

    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Human activities since the Industrial Revolution, particularly\n",
    "the accumulated carbon dioxide emissions from the intensive fossil\n",
    "fuels consumption, have resulted in significant increase of the\n",
    "atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, which exacer-\n",
    "bated climate change primarily characterized by global warming\n",
    "[1]. Global warming has significant impacts on global natural\n",
    "ecosystems, causing temperature increase and sea level rise as well\n",
    "as more frequent extreme climate events, all of which pose a huge\n",
    "challenge to the survival and development of the human race [2].\n",
    "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [3] reported\n",
    "the year 2100 could witness a global temperature increase of\n",
    "1.1-6.4 °C and a sea level rise of 16.5-53.8 cm. Moreover, annual\n",
    "report by the IPCC [4] identified that 1983-2012 was likely the\n",
    "warmest 30-year period during the last 1400 years, and the land\n",
    "surface temperature increased by 0.85°C during 1880-2012,\n",
    "which could lead to substantial species extinction and global food\n",
    "supply and demand imbalance. More seriously, according to the\n",
    "report by the United Nation Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, over\n",
    "600,000 people died and 4.1 billion people wounded from extreme\n",
    "weather over the last two decades, inflicting economic loss of over\n",
    "1.9 trillion dollars [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly appreciated that the major increase in Green-\n",
    "house Gas (GHG) is largely attributed to carbon dioxide (CO2) as\n",
    "the principal gas leading to global warming. According to the Fifth\n",
    "Report of the IPCC [4], the total amount of global carbon emission\n",
    "has increased from 9434.4 million tons in 1961 to 34649.4 million\n",
    "tons in 2011, which may double or even triple by the middle of\n",
    "this century if it fails to be effectively controlled. Stern [6] further\n",
    "warned that, if no action was taken to reduce carbon emission, the\n",
    "overall costs and risks of global warming would be equivalent to a\n",
    "loss of 5% annual global GDP. It is therefore considered urgent to\n",
    "conduct the carbon emission reduction at the global level. To do\n",
    "that efficiently, it is significant to identify the KIFs affecting car-\n",
    "bon emission in different countries at global level, which may\n",
    "directly influence the constitution of the carbon emission reduc-\n",
    "tion measures, policies and strategies [7]. The research by Wang\n",
    "‘. [8] and Li ‘. [9] echoed this view and proposed that\n",
    "investigating the KIFs of carbon emissions is the key to making\n",
    "polices and conducting scenario analysis for carbon emission\n",
    "reduction efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this paper aims to identify the KIFs of carbon emis-\n",
    "sion in different countries, and proposed the applicable policy\n",
    "implications for the governments to effectively conduct the global\n",
    "carbon emission reduction. The innovation and contribution of this\n",
    "paper compared with other references mainly lies in the following\n",
    "two aspects. On one hand, this research innovatively applies both\n",
    "the time-series and panel data analysis to identify the KIFs in dif-\n",
    "ferent countries to ensure the empirical results more reliable. On\n",
    "the other hand, this is the first study providing detailed country-\n",
    "by-country analyses aiming to identify the KIFs of carbon emission\n",
    "in 125 individual countries. These KIFs findings provide national\n",
    "governments with a scientific basis for effective and targeted\n",
    "policy-making, which is a contribution particularly for global car-\n",
    "bon reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2\n",
    "reviews the literatures applying the IPAT method to identify the\n",
    "KIFs. Section 3 introduces the IPAT and STIRPAT models,\n",
    "time-series and panel data. Section 4 presents the steps for\n",
    "identifying the KIFs with STIRPAT model. Section 5 displays the\n",
    "empirical analysis conducted to identify the KIFs. Section 6 demon-\n",
    "strates the discussion on the results from the empirical analysis.\n",
    "Section 7 draws a conclusion and raised policy implications of this\n",
    "study.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Literature review\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, various methods have been developed for identifying\n",
    "the KIFs. Based on the comprehensive literature review, methods\n",
    "frequently adopted are summarized as shown in Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 lists four methods to identify KIFs. The results from the\n",
    "first three methods, namely ISM, SNA and SEM, were found rela-\n",
    "tively subjective, since the samples for data analysis are basically\n",
    "from questionnaire survey rather than the actual statistics data\n",
    "[10]. However, the results from IPAT are objective as the samples\n",
    "of IPAT are based on the actual statistics data. Therefore, this\n",
    "research adopts the IPAT method to identify the KIFs of carbon\n",
    "emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPAT method is universally applied to identify the KIFs of\n",
    "carbon emission in numerous previous studies at industrial, regio-\n",
    "nal and national level. For example, at the industrial level, Xu and\n",
    "Lin [11] investigated the KIFs of carbon emission in China’s iron\n",
    "and steel industry by applying IPAT model with panel data analy-\n",
    "sis. Similarly, Xu and Lin [12] explored the KIFs of carbon emission\n",
    "in China’s transport sector using IPAT model with dynamic non-\n",
    "parametric additive regression. Zhang and Liu [13] used the ran-\n",
    "dom form of IPAT model, i.e. STIRPAT, to study the KIFs of carbon\n",
    "emission in the Information and Communication Technology\n",
    "(ICT) industry in China.\n",
    "\n",
    "At regional level, for example, Tan ‘. [14] selected Chongq-\n",
    "ing, a city in China as an example to analyze the KIFs of carbon\n",
    "emission by using STIRPAT. Wang ‘. [15] analyzed the KIFs of\n",
    "carbon emission in Beijing, the capital China, and concluded that\n",
    "carbon emission is dominantly driven by population and inhibited\n",
    "by technology. Li ‘. [16] adopted the STIRPAT model with par-\n",
    "tial least squares regression to identify the KIFs of carbon emission\n",
    "in Tianjin, China and pointed out that technology is the key influ-\n",
    "ence factor. Wang ‘. [17] also employed the STIRPAT model\n",
    "with scenario analysis to find out the main driving factors of car-\n",
    "bon emission in Shanghai, China. Using the STIRPAT model with\n",
    "ridge regression, Wang ‘. [18] revealed the population factor\n",
    "is the KIF of carbon emission in Guangdong province, China. The\n",
    "research of Deng and Dong [19] stressed affluence is the KIF of car-\n",
    "bon emission from coal consumption in Shandong province by\n",
    "employing the STIRPAT model with vector autoregression. Yue\n",
    "‘. [20] combined the IPAT model with scenario analysis to opti-\n",
    "mize carbon emission reduction in Jiangsu province, China and\n",
    "concluded that economic growth is the KIF of carbon emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to national level, the research by Zhou and Liu\n",
    "[21] studied the KIFs of carbon emission in China by using the\n",
    "STIRPAT model with balanced provincial panel data. Burnett ‘.\n",
    "[22] integrated the IPAT model with Kaya identity to analyze the\n",
    "relationship of the carbon Kuznets curve in US, and suggested that\n",
    "economic growth is the KIF of carbon emission. By applying the\n",
    "IPAT model with input-output analysis, Cansino ‘. [23] tested\n",

    "The above discussions suggest that the IPAT method has been\n",
    "widely employed to identify the KIFs of carbon emission at indus-\n",

    "of carbon emission at global level as such the study by Fan ‘.\n",
    "[7], in which the STIRPAT model was adopted to analyze the KIFs\n",
    "of carbon emission at global level. However, this study is different\n",
    "with Fan ‘. [7] from the following three aspects. Firstly, Fan\n",
    "‘. [7] employed the aggregated or averaged value of each factor.\n",
    "However, this study applied original value with both the time-\n",
    "series data analysis for 125 individual countries and panel data\n",
    "analysis for worldwide level and four income levels, which enables\n",
    "the empirical results with more credibility. Secondly, the regres-\n",
    "sion method is directly used to investigate the KIFs in their study.\n",
    "However, in order to obtain a more robust result, unit root test, and\n",
    "cointegration test are additionally conducted as steps in the regres-\n",
    "sion, which are helpful to avoid the spurious regression and ensure\n",
    "the long-run equilibrium relationship between variables. Thirdly,\n",
    "the KIFs of countries at the high income (HI), upper-middle-\n",
    "income (UMI), lower-middle-income (LMI) and low income (LI)\n",
    "levels are identified in Fan ‘.’s [7] study. Moreover, this study\n",
    "identifies not only the KIFs of the countries at the global, HI,\n",
    "UMI, LMI and LI levels, but also of 125 individual countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method and data\n",
    "3.1. The IPAT and SPIRPAT models\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1971, IPAT approach was firstly introduced by Ehrlich and\n",
    "Holdren [24] to study how the growing population influence the\n",
    "natural environment. The IPAT equation can be represented as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "[=PxAxT (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "where [ denotes the environmental impact, which is carbon emis-\n",
    "sion in this study. P represents population, A represents affluence\n",
    "per capita, and T denotes the technology. Using this model as a\n",
    "basis, Dietz developed the STIRPAT model [25]. The STIRPAT model\n",
    "maintains the relations among environmental pressure, population,\n",
    "affluence and technology, but is modified to overcome the unit elas-\n",
    "ticity assumption within the IPAT model and adds randomness for\n",
    "convenience of empirical analysis. The STIRPAT model is formulated\n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "fy = aPPASTie; (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking logarithms, the model can be represented as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "ink, = @ + b(EnP,) + c(LnAy) + d(LnT,) +e; (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "where subscript i denotes the country samples; t denotes the year;\n",
    "b, c, and d are the coefficients reflecting the importance of P, A, and T\n",
    "respectively. The larger value of coefficient the more important\n",
    "variable is. e is the error term, and a is the constant. Eq. (3) presents\n",
    "the linear relationship between population, affluence and technol-\n",
    "ogy. In this study, the STIRPAT model is applied to identify the KIFs\n",
    "of carbon emission. Besides, previous studies provide guidelines for\n",
    "choosing variables to measure these factors. Table 2 lists the defini-\n",
    "tions and supporting references of variables used in this research.\n",
    "As shown in Table 2, population usually refers to urban popula-\n",

    "This study identified the KIFs on carbon emission of 125 coun-\n",

    "and time-series data. These empirical results evidence that the\n",
    "impacts of population, affluence and technology on carbon emis-\n",
    "sion vary at different income levels. Panel data analysis results\n",
    "reveal that the KIF of global panel group is affluence, followed by\n",
    "technology, and population in the order of impact significance.\n",
    "As to the HI panel group, the KIF is technology, followed by popu-\n",
    "lation and affluence. The KIF of UMI and LMI and LI panel group is\n",
    "affluence. In particular, there are two regular patterns found\n",
    "through the empirical results: the impact of technology on carbon\n",
    "emission increases with the income level; on the contrary, the\n",
    "impact of affluence decreases with the income level. Meanwhile,\n",
    "time-series data analysis of 125 individual countries found that\n",
    "at global level, affluence is the KIF for 55% countries, technology\n",

    "that there are 61% of countries at HI level that the KIF is technol-\n",

    "First, previous studies selected limited amount of factors (usually\n",
    "less than seven), while this study systematically selected the 43\n",
    "PIFs by reviewing the previous studies that explore the KIFs in\n",

    "relation between multiple PIFs, which makes the results more\n",
    "reliable. The contributions of this research are from the theoretical\n",
    "and practical aspects. Theoretically, this study provides a more in-\n",
    "tegrated and accurate group of KIFs of carbon emission. The\n",
    "methodology can serve as a guidance for scientifically selecting\n",

    "waste water. Practically, the identified KIFs in this study are valu-\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Literature review\n",
    "2.1. Methods for identifying the KIFs of carbon emission\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods for identifying the KIFs, such as\n",
    "interpretive structural modeling (Samantra ‘., 2016), social\n",
    "network analysis (Webster ‘., 2016) and structural equation\n",
    "model (Xiong ‘., 2014). However, these methods were critiqued\n",
    "relatively subjective, since the data used in these methods are from\n",
    "questionnaire surveys rather than the second-hand data (Shen\n",
    "‘., 2016). The samples of carbon emission are actual second-\n",
    "hand data, which indicates these methods are inappropriate for\n",
    "identifying KIFs on carbon emission in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current methods for exploring the KIFs of carbon emission\n",
    "can be classified into two categories, namely Kaya identity and\n",
    "STIRPAT (Wu ‘., 2016). Wu ‘. (2016) employed the Kaya\n",
    "identity with Monte Carlo simulation to examine the KIFs of carbon\n",
    "emission in China. Sumabat ‘. (2016) applied the re-write Kaya\n",
    "identity to analyze factors that influence carbon emissions due to\n",
    "\n",
    "fossil energy consumption in China to explore key factors for pol-\n",
    "icies promoting CER. Nian ‘. (2014) combined the Kaya identity\n",
    "and the decomposition technique to identify KIFs of carbon emis-\n",
    "sion from nuclear power generation. Similarly, Shahiduzzaman and\n",
    "Layton (2015) decomposed the Kaya identity into population, GDP\n",
    "per capita, energy intensity and carbon intensity to examine the\n",
    "KIFs in the United States. Conventionally, using the Kaya identity,\n",
    "carbon emission is decomposed into limited factors as the\n",
    "decomposed factors needed to be explained logically and possess\n",
    "the real meaning. However, STIRPAT, derived from IPAT model,\n",
    "describes environmental impact (f) as a function of population (P),\n",
    "affluence (A) and technology (T) with stochastic status, and each\n",
    "function can be represented into different factors. As STIRPAT\n",
    "model can be expanded to incorporate unlimited additional factors,\n",
    "this method became a well-known technique that was widely\n",
    "adopted to identify the KIFs of carbon emissions. For example,\n",
    "Wang ‘. (2017) selected eight PIFs of carbon emission using\n",
    "STIRPAT model for examining the KIFs in Xinjiang, China.\n",
    "Employing STIRPAT model with panel data analysis, the research by\n",
    "Poumanyvong and Kaneko (2010) identified the critical KIFs of\n",
    "carbon emission in 99 countries from eight nominated factors. This\n",
    "method is thus adopted to explore KIFs of carbon emission based on\n",
    "the PIFs in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2. PIFs of carbon emission\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies that examined the KIFs of the carbon emission select\n",
    "different PIFs. The PIFs are reviewed and listed in Table 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be easily shown from Table 1 that different researchers\n",
    "select different PIFs in their studies to identify KIFs. For example.\n",
    "Wang ‘. (2012) selected factors including urbanization rate, GDP\n",
    "per capita, the share of the industry output value over the total GDP,\n",
    "and the share of the tertiary industry output value over the total\n",
    "GDP as the PIFs to explore the KIFs of carbon emission in Beijing,\n",
    "China. Li ‘. (2015) examined the KIFs of carbon emission in\n",
    "Tianjin city on the basis of factors such as foreign direct investment,\n",
    "total permanent population, and energy use per GDP; Wang ‘.\n",
    "(2017) used factors including total population, total fixed assets\n",
    "investment, percentage of gross import and export value to GDP\n",
    "and percentage of coal consumption to total energy consumption\n",
    "for studying Xinjiang, China; Zoundi (2016) adopted renewable\n",
    "energy consumption per capita population growth and GDP per\n",
    "capita as the PIFs to examine the KIFs in 25 African countries; and\n",
    "the PIFs adopted in de Alegria ‘. (2016) are renewable energy\n",
    "consumption share as a proportion of total Primary Consumption,\n",
    "total population and energy intensity; and Ohlan (2015) analyzed\n",
    "the KIFs of carbon emission in India using the factors including\n",
    "energy consumption per capita, GDP per capita, population density\n",
    "and the total exports and imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inconsistence of using potential factors for one category not\n",
    "only happens for different regions, but also happens between the\n",
    "researches on identifying the KIFs in the same region. For identi-\n",
    "fying KIFs in China, Zhou and Liu (2016) used factors such as the\n",
    "share of the working-age population (16—64 years old), average\n",
    "household size, and GDP per capita as the PIFs; Xu and Lin (2017)\n",
    "used the total energy use divided by GDP, industry's coal con-\n",
    "sumption by its total energy consumption and urbanization rate as\n",
    "the PIFs; Xu ‘. (2016) used GDP per unit energy consumption,\n",
    "total population and the ratio of industry sector value added in GDP\n",
    "as the PIFs; and Guan ‘. (2017) adopted farmers annual net in-\n",
    "come per capita, population density, urban employment and the\n",
    "ratio of tertiary industry sector value added in GDP as the PIFs. The\n",
    "inconsistence of selecting PIFs definitely leads to the differences of\n",
    "the identified KIFs between their studies, which could partially\n",
    "guide the CER. Therefore, it is important to enlarge the pool of PIFs\n",

    "which will increase the carbon emission. However, the research by\n",
    "Sharma (2011) proposed that the population growth will eventually\n",

    "The results echo with these studies. In Model 8, the significant\n",

    "As shown in Fig. 4 (World Bank, 2015), the ratio of the renewable\n",
    "energy is declining from approximately 30% to 15% during the study\n",
    "period (1995—2014). In other words, the ratio of fossil fuels such as\n",
    "coal has been dramatically increasing, which indicates this trend\n",
    "will induce more carbon emission rather than contributing the CER.\n",
    "The ratio of renewable energy is far lower than that of some other\n",
    "developed countries such as Iceland, Finland and Norway. Zhang\n",
    "and Lin (2012) explained that the relative low utilization of\n",
    "renewable energy in China is due to the rapid industrialization\n",

    "data collected for analysis are only available for the period of 1995e2014, this study focuses on the factor\n",
    "analysis for the stage S2 and S3. The results show that the main driving factor for carbon emission increase in the stage S2 is economic output, followed by population scale, while the main factor contributes\n",
    "to carbon emission reduction in this stage is the industrial structure. In the stage S3, the economic output\n",
    "is the top contributor to increase carbon emission, followed by population scale and energy structure,\n",
    "whereas energy intensity is the main inﬂuencing factor in curbing the carbon emission. Although the\n",

    "the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between per\n",
    "capita income and the environment quality, suggesting that while\n",
    "levels of environmental damage increase ﬁrst with rising per capita\n",
    "GDP, then subsequently decline (Grossman and Krueger, 1994). This\n",
    "theory has been widely used for analyzing the relationship between carbon emission and economic development at country or\n",
    "regional level (Alam ‘., 2016; Lantz and Feng, 2006; Zoundi,\n",
    "2017). And the relationship has also been examined at city-level\n",
    "in urban China by several studies (Wang and Ye, 2017; Zhao ‘.,\n",
    "2016).\n",
    "There are two procedures in using EKC principle in this study.\n",
    "The ﬁrst process is to calculate the carbon emission for a concerned\n",

    "the oxidation rate of the fuel i.\n",
    "The second process in using EKC principle is to establish the\n",

    "as energy structure (CE ), denoted as ES; energy intensity (GDP\n",
    "denoted as EI; economic output (GDP\n",
    "P ), denoted as EO; and population scale P. In other words, carbon emission factors are derived to\n",
    "four factors.\n",
    "However, Kaya identity does not consider the inﬂuence of industrial structure, which is commonly measured by the ratio of\n",
    "industrial added value to the GDP. In fact, according to previous\n",
    "studies, industrial structure has great impact on energy conservation and carbon emission (Chang, 2015; Mi ‘., 2014). Tian ‘.\n",
    "(2014) found that there is a disparity in carbon emission between\n",
    "different regions as they have different regional industrial structures. Therefore, it is important to add the industrial structure as a\n",

    "used in this study. There are two types of index in using IDA\n",
    "methods: the Laspeyres index and the Divisia index. By Laspeyres\n",

    "Statistical Yearbooks and Table 2, the per capita GDP increased by\n",
    "207% at the 1995 constant price during the surveyed period\n",
    "1995e2004. This dramatically increase of per capita GDP brought\n",
    "the substantial increase of individual income, which in turn pushed\n",
    "the greater demand for energy products. As a result, energy consumption increased by 169% from 1995 to 2004, which was\n",
    "accompanied by higher carbon emission. In fact, this ﬁnding is in\n",
    "line with the research results by Fan and Lei (2017) and Xu ‘.\n",
    "(2016), suggesting that economic growth in Beijing contributes\n",
    "signiﬁcantly to the increase of carbon emission. One the other hand,\n",
    "as the most basic element for production, energy supports economic development. In other words, the increase of energy consumption is the results of economic development (Zhou and Liu,\n",
    "2016). This applies to Beijing case where economic growth relies\n",
    "largely on the increase of energy consumption, which unfortunately induces the increase of carbon emission in the city. Therefore, it is vital to ﬁnd ways that allow the economic development\n",
    "with less dependence on energy consumption. Furthermore, the\n",
    "fact that EO has much higher inﬂuence on carbon emission at this\n",
    "stage than other emission factors indicates that Beijing emphasizes\n",
    "more on the speed of economic growth than improving the quality\n",
    "of the economy. Therefore, it is important to adopt proper measures\n",
    "for promoting sustainable economic development with both speed\n",
    "and quality, and seek a balance between economy and environment\n",
    "(Tan ‘., 2017).\n",
    "P (population scale) is another driving factor for carbon emission increase in Beijing at this development stage, with smaller\n",
    "effects than that from the factor EO. It is widely appreciated that\n",
    "population living in urban areas grows when economic develops\n",
    "(Shen ‘., 2016a, 2017a). According to the data in Beijing Statistical Yearbooks, the population of Beijing increased from 1251   104\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 4. Cumulative effects of factors on carbon emission in Beijing during 2004e2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "persons in 1995 to 1499   104 persons in 2004, with an increase\n",
    "rate of 19.8%. This is a relatively slow increase rate in comparing to\n",
    "economic growth which was 207% during the same period. And the\n",
    "relative slow increase in population is mainly due to the implementation of the “family planning” and “one-child” policy. However, the increase of population inevitably leads to a greater\n",
    "demand for household appliance (e.g., air conditioning and refrigerator), housing and transportation, and these in turn contribute to\n",
    "the increase of energy use and carbon emission (Yang ‘., 2015).\n",
    "This also echoes with the traditional Malthusian view that population growth has a severe impact on carbon emission (Malthus,\n",
    "1973). Furthermore, the shift of population age structure in Beijing has also led to the increase of carbon emission (Yang ‘.,\n",
    "2015). According to Beijing Statistical Yearbooks, the proportion\n",
    "of working age population (population aged 15e64) and aging\n",
    "population (people older than 65 years) rose by 5.7% and 3.4%\n",
    "respectively during 1995e2004, whereas the proportion of young\n",
    "population (population under 15) decreased by 9%. In fact, as the\n",
    "main labor force, working age population promotes the development of labor-intensive industries such as manufacturing which is\n",
    "normally high energy-consumption industry, and has a high correlation with carbon emission (Zhu and Peng, 2012). In referring to\n",
    "aging population, it triggers high demands for products and services such as medical care and maintenance services, which lead to\n",
    "the increase of carbon emission (Menz and Welsch, 2012; Yang\n",
    "‘., 2015). Furthermore, as for young population, its effects on\n",
    "carbon emission are not as signiﬁcant as that from other groups,\n",
    "and this is consistent with the results of Cole and Neumayer (2004)\n",

    "According to Fig. 4, the most signiﬁcant driving factor on carbon\n",
    "emission at the development S3 was economic output (EO), followed by population scale (P) and energy structure (ES). This\n",
    "\n",
    "ﬁnding about the relative signiﬁcance between the three emission\n",
    "factors (EO, P, ES) is consistent with the conclusion in the study by\n",
    "Xu ‘. (2016).\n",
    "The effect of EO on the increase of carbon emission during this\n",
    "stage was signiﬁcant. The rapid growth of economy in this stage\n",
    "demands more energy, causing undoubtedly an increase in carbon\n",
    "emission. However, there are some interesting ﬁndings when\n",
    "comparing the contribution of economic output to carbon emission\n",
    "in the development stage S2. Firstly, although the average value of\n",
    "EO in the stage S3 was more than 1.3 times of that in the stage S2,\n",
    "the effect of EO on carbon emission in stage S3 was less than that of\n",
    "the stage S2. Secondly, as seen in Table 4, the effect of EO on carbon\n",
    "emission did not show a steady growth although the EO itself\n",
    "showed the steady increase in this stage. These two ﬁndings reveal\n",
    "the fact that Beijing city has been upgrading its industrial structure,\n",
    "thus it can achieve good economic growth whilst keep the effect of\n",
    "economic output on carbon emission at a certain level (Fan and Lei,\n",
    "2017). However, it is worth noting that the contribution of EO to\n",
    "carbon emission is still high in Beijing. Therefore, it is a long-term\n",
    "strategy to implement low-carbon economy measures such as\n",
    "upgrading industrial structure. Other measures are also proposed\n",
    "for promoting low-carbon economy, such as carbon taxation and\n",

    "carbon emission reduction (Fan and Lei, 2017; Shen ‘., 2016b;\n",
    " ez ‘., 2016; Zhang ‘., 2016).\n",
    "Villoria-Sa\n",
    "Population scale was still a driving factor for the increase of\n",
    "carbon emission in Beijing during the stage S3 (2004e2014), which\n",
    "has much higher inﬂuence on the carbon emission in comparing to\n",
    "that in the development stage S2. In fact, Beijing has witnessed\n",
    "great migration from rural to urban in recent years, the total population of Beijing had exceeded 15 million in 2004 and reached to\n",
    "21.5 million in the end of 2014. The increase rate of population scale\n",
    "in the stage S3 was 44.1%, and it was much higher than that in the\n",
    "stage S2 (19.8%), this rapid expansion of population during the stage\n",
    "S3 aggravates the increase of demand for energy, resulting in the\n",
    "increase of carbon emission. This results also accord with the fact\n",
    "suggested by Yang ‘. (2015) that Beijing is suffering from serious\n",
    "problems of over population and increasing carbon emission. As\n",
    "the capital of China, Beijing has advantageous resources, which\n",
    "attract a large population of both outstanding talents and workingage people (population aged 15e64). According to Beijing Statistical\n",

    "Fig. 6, which shows that the percentages of the three age groups\n",
    "have little changes. Thus, the shift of population age structure in\n",
    "Beijing in stage S3 (2004e2014) has not led to the signiﬁcant increase of carbon emission as it does in the stage S2. However, this\n",
    "ﬁgure reveals the fact that working-age people accounted for the\n",
    "vast majority of the total population (about 80%) during the stage\n",
    "S3. This is in line with the assessment of Zhang and Song (2003),\n",
    "suggesting that working-age population has made the dominant\n",
    "contribution to the population growth. The increase of working-age\n",
    "population at this stage not only speeds up the process of urbanization in Beijing but also promotes the development of laborintensive industries, which in turn propel the increase of carbon\n",
    "emission (Yang ‘., 2015). It is widely appreciated that Beijing's\n",
    "population will most likely continue to grow in the near future\n",
    "(Liang and Wang, 2017; Wang ‘., 2013b; Yang ‘., 2015). This\n",
    "population growth will be accompanied by the resource consumption and carbon emission. Consequently, it can be expected\n",
    "that the inﬂuences of population on carbon emission in Beijing will\n",
    "remain to increase (Wang and Yang, 2016). Therefore, it is vital to\n",
    "improve the existing household registration system in order to\n",
    "attract migrant workers to different urban areas apart from Beijing\n",
    "(Fan and Lei, 2017). Furthermore, low-carbon lifestyle and lowcarbon consumption should be promoted in Beijing, such as using\n",
    "low-carbon products and saving electricity in daily life, thus the\n",
    "coordinated development of human-environment can be achieved\n",
    "(Chen ‘., 2014).\n",
    "Furthermore, ES (energy structure) was also the pulling factor on\n",
    "the increase of carbon emission in Beijing during 2004e2014.\n",
    "Scholars have not reached an agreement that whether the impact of\n",
    "energy structure on carbon emission in Beijing is positive or\n",
    "negative (Fan and Lei, 2017). Fig. 4 in this study reveals that the\n",
    "energy structure had a positive effect on the increase of carbon\n",
    "emission during 2004e2014, although such effect is not as much as\n",
    "that by factors EO and P. This may owe to the change of energy\n",
    "source structure between coal, oil and natural gas. Since 2004,\n",
    "Beijing has adopted a series of measures reducing the use of coal,\n",
    "such as replacing coal with oil and gas and closing certain coalintensive factories (Fan and Lei, 2017). Although the reduction in\n",
    "using coal is limited, it still has certain contribution to carbon\n",
    "emission reduction in Beijing. However, the accelerated urbanization and industrialization lead to unavoidable use of coal as energy\n",
    "(Zhang and Lin, 2012). And the energy structure dominated by coal\n",
    "cannot be changed in the short term (Fan and Lei, 2017; Xu ‘.,\n",
    "2016). This explains why the effect of energy structure on the carbon emission in Beijing is positive during the stage S3, and indicates\n",
    "that reducing the use of coal will remain as a major strategy for\n",
    "controlling carbon emission. This further highlights the signiﬁcance\n",
    "of increasing the use of clean energy and renewable energy (e.g.,\n",
    "wind, nuclear and tidal energy) for the exchange of coal energy in\n",
    "Beijing (Lin and Moubarak, 2014).\n",

    "\n",
    "In view of the carbon emission reduction during stage S3, both\n",
    "the industrial structure (IS) and energy intensity (EI) were the\n",
    "contributors. But the effect by EI was much larger than that by IS,\n",
    "which is in line with the conclusions of the studies by Zhang ‘.\n",
    "(2013), Xu ‘. (2014, 2016) and Wei ‘. (2017). As seen in Fig. 7,\n",
    "the energy intensity for the three industries showed a downward\n",
    "trend during the stage S3, especially for the secondary industry\n",
    "which accounts for the majority of the total energy consumption. It\n",
    "suggests that the energy efﬁciency in Beijing has made great strides\n",
    "particularly in its secondary industry, and contributes signiﬁcantly\n",
    "to restricting the increase of carbon emission in this city. In fact,\n",
    "Beijing has been adopting various advanced technologies in\n",
    "improving energy efﬁciency in recent years. For example, many\n",
    "electric power sectors and chemistry sectors in Beijing have been\n",
    "devoting efforts in using clean energy such as solar energy and\n",
    "wind power to reduce fossil fuels (Wang ‘., 2013b). Furthermore,\n",
    "Beijing government has been increasing the investment in\n",
    "improving energy efﬁciency. For example, the technical contract\n",
    "sum of reasonable energy production and utilization was 5.65\n",
    "billion yuan in 2014, more than 10 times of that in 2004 (National\n",
    "Bureau of Statistics of Beijing (NBSB), 2015). This increase of technical investment not only contributes to the reduction of the production emission, but also stimulates the enterprises towards to the\n",
    "practice of low-carbon production (Brizga ‘., 2014). In other\n",
    "words, carbon emission reduction by the means of reducing energy\n",
    "intensity can be achieved by applying advanced technologies and\n",
    "increasing technical investment (Wang ‘., 2012b, 2012c). Measures such as sharing and transferring low-carbon technologies\n",
    "between regions should be promoted, which can not only optimize\n",
    "the utilization of resources but also accelerate the development of\n",
    "carbon emission reduction technology.\n",
    "5. Conclusions\n",
    "Developing low-carbon city (LCC) is an important strategy for\n",
    "achieving carbon emission reduction in China. However, cities\n",
    "present different development stages and carbon emission scenarios, due to different urbanization level, economic development\n",
    "and industrial structure. This study analyzes the driving factors on\n",

    "established and four development stages are identiﬁed. Three types\n",
    "of EKCs between carbon emission and economic growth have been\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the “Global Greenhouse Gas Bulletin” issued by the\n",
    "World Meteorological Organization on October 30, 2017, the concentra-\n",
    "tion of CO, in the air rose at an alarmingly rapid rate in 2016, reaching\n",
    "the highest level in the past 800,000 years, which made the global atmo-\n",
    "sphere in danger. Therefore, methods to reduce CO, emissions and\n",
    "achieve a low-carbon economy have become significant topics world-\n",
    "wide. The key lies in measuring CO2 emissions from energy consump-\n",
    "tion and studying the factors influencing carbon emissions. Given the\n",
    "characteristics of “rich coal, lacking oil and gas”, China has become the\n",
    "world's largest energy consumer, the largest oil importer and the sec-\n",
    "ond largest liquid natural gas (LNG) importer. According to the Interna-\n",
    "tional Energy Agency (IEA), in 2017, annual CO, emissions of global\n",
    "fossil fuels have increased to 36.3 billion tons, and about one-third\n",
    "came from China. To slow down the increase in carbon emissions,\n",
    "China proposed a reduction of its CO2 emissions per unit gross domestic\n",
    "product (GDP) by 60-65% in 2030 (in comparison with the emissions in\n",
    "2005), under the framework of the Paris Agreement; meanwhile, a car-\n",
    "bon emissions peak will be achieved. This is not only China's strong\n",
    "commitment to the international community but also an inevitable\n",
    "choice for China to achieve sustainable development. On the other\n",
    "hand, as the largest developing country, China's economic development\n",
    "will have a structural impact on the world political and economic pat-\n",
    "tern. At present, with the increase in domestic consumption and the de-\n",
    "velopment of energy-intensive industries, China is facing enormous\n",
    "pressure to reduce its CO. emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to mea-\n",

    "process of COz emission reduction in China and worldwide in the future\n",
    "(Fig. 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, in the study of energy consumption, there are two general\n",
    "decomposition methods used worldwide on measurements of carbon\n",
    "emissions to determine its influencing factors: One method is the struc-\n",
    "tural decomposition approach (SDA). SDA was first proposed by Indian\n",
    "scholar Debesh (2006) in 2006 to solve the input-output structural de-\n",
    "composition problem. Later, Shang and Jiang (2009) introduced SDA to\n",
    "the decomposition of China's energy consumption structure. Subse-\n",
    "quently, SDA has been widely used in the structural decomposition\n",
    "and analysis of carbon emissions in China (e.g., Wang ‘., 2012; Xu\n",
    "‘., 2012; Duan and Yang, 2017). SDA is based on input-output tables\n",
    "and requires input-output data. However, China generally compiles\n",
    "input-output tables every five years, which is a long time span and is\n",
    "not conducive to in-depth research. Therefore, a second method,\n",
    "\n",
    "X. Ma ‘. / Science of the Total Environment 648 (2019) 1411-1420\n",
    "\n",
    "known as the index decomposition approach (IDA), is generally\n",
    "adopted. IDA is based on departmental summation data and is suitable\n",
    "for time-series analysis. In addition, IDA is more feasible for practical ap-\n",
    "plications. The logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition\n",
    "method based on IDA was first proposed in 2004 and introduced to\n",
    "the decomposition of energy consumption (Ang, 2004). This method\n",
    "can decompose multiple factors, and the decomposed result also solves\n",
    "the problem of residual items, data zeros and negatives. Therefore, it is\n",
    "widely used in the establishment and analysis of the CO2 emissions\n",
    "driver decomposition model. Based on the LMDI decomposition\n",
    "method, the measurement of CO emissions and their influencing fac-\n",
    "tors can be studied at national, provincial, municipal, regional and in-\n",
    "dustry levels. Xu ‘. (2012), Fan (2013) and Chong ‘. (2015)\n",
    "used the LMDI method to decompose and analyze the driving factors\n",
    "of carbon emissions due to China's energy consumption. Regarding\n",
    "China's carbon emissions, the contribution rate from economic output\n",
    "is the greatest. Ramachandra and Shwetmala (2012) analysed the rela-\n",
    "tionship between India’s high level of energy consumption and lower\n",
    "per capita emissions. And it showed that low energy efficiency and\n",
    "weak policies were the main factors of increasing total emissions;\n",
    "Brizga ‘. (2013) analysed the effect of energy intensity, energy mix,\n",
    "and population on COz emissions in the former Soviet Union from\n",
    "1990 to 2010. The results show that these factors play different roles\n",
    "during different stages of economic development. Alam ‘. (2016)\n",
    "discussed the effects of income, energy consumption and population\n",
    "growth on CO, emissions in India, Indonesia, China and Brazil during\n",
    "1970-2012 but failed to quantify the driving factors. Additionally,\n",
    "some scholars have combined the LMDI with the spatial autocorrelation\n",
    "method, Cobb-Douglas production function or other techniques to\n",
    "study energy consumption in China (Cheng ‘., 2013; Wang ‘.,\n",
    "2014). Some other scholars applied the LMDI to the European Union,\n",
    "Iran, Middle Eastern countries and countries along the Belt and Road\n",
    "to track and decompose their CO, emissions (Gonzalez ‘., 2014;\n",
    "Mousavi ‘., 2017; Guo ‘., 2018). With the development of regional\n",

    "(2) Some literatures have mixed up coal data and raw coal data when\n",

    "statistics, coal data include raw coal data, and in the calculation of carbon\n",

    "selected three kinds of GHG emissions, not merely CO2 emissions in previous works. Then, to investigate how different sectors affect GHG emissions, the growth of GHG emissions is further decomposed into the\n",

    "There are two kinds of raw data: the multi-regional input-output table and GHG emissions data. In this paper, the multi-regional inputoutput tables were used to investigate the reasons behind global GHG growth by 40 regions. This paper utilized the WIOD, which covers 27\n",
    "European countries and 13 other major countries in the world. The details of 40 countries are shown in Table 3.\n",
    "The GHG emissions data also come from WIOD. The “Environmental Accounts” in WIOD provide the environmental accounts including\n",
    "industry energy use, CO2 emissions and emissions to air in the world (Timmer ‘., 2015). The environmental accounts mainly contain\n",
    "eight kinds of emissions to air. Among them, CO2, CH4, and N2O will cause greenhouse effects. Therefore, these three kinds of greenhouse\n",
    "gases were selected.\n",
    "After collecting the intercountry input-output tables and environmental accounts, unifying the sector classiﬁcation is necessary.\n",
    "Considering the “International Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation revision 3 and revision 4 (ISIC Rev. 3 & Rev.4)”, data for 35 sectors are\n",
    "classiﬁed by merging and unifying the category of the whole economic activities. Table 4 shows the classiﬁcation of 35 sectors and their\n",

    "3. Decomposition results\n",
    "3.1. Aggregate decomposition results\n",
    "This part shows the aggregate decomposition results of driving\n",
    "forces of CO 2 , CH4 and N 2 O. Fig. 1 displays the changes of each\n",
    "decomposition factor and the total effects of consumption-based\n",
    "GHG emissions from 1995 to 2009. According to the classiﬁcation\n",
    "of each country, all countries are divided into 3 groups: developing,\n",
    "developed and other countries (ROW). For simplicity, the consumption expansion effect, investment expansion effect, net export effect,\n",
    "emission intensity effect and Leontief effects are denoted as C, INV,\n",
    "NX, EI and L, respectively. Note that, the decomposition results of\n",
    "three kinds of GHG emissions from 1995 to 2009 for all 40 countries\n",
    "are shown in Appendix.\n",
    "In three periods, the total effects of CO2 are all positive, which means\n",
    "that the global CO2 emissions are on a rising trend. The decomposition\n",
    "results of CO2 emissions highlight that global rapid economic growth is\n",
    "the dominating driving force for contributing the rising of CO2 emissions.\n",
    "However, due to the improvement of energy efﬁciency and technology\n",
    "innovation, it is found that the emission intensities in most countries\n",
    "are going through a downward trend, which indicated that emission\n",
    "intensity effects are decoupling the growth of CO2 and economic growth\n",
    "to a certain degree. It is noteworthy that nearly all EI effects in three period are negative except for the developed countries in 1995–1999. In\n",
    "appendix, it is found that the unstable ﬂuctuation of EI effect appeared\n",
    "in the period of 1995–2000 mainly comes from Russia (RUS). From\n",
    "October 1997 to August 1998, Russia experienced three great ﬁnancial\n",

    "development. C, INV, and NX can be distinguished respectively when\n",
    "\n",
    "looking in more detail at the economic development. Undoubtedly,\n",
    "consumption, investment and net export effects are basically all\n",
    "positive.2\n",
    "There are some differences in different country groups. It is\n",
    "noteworthy that the investment effects in developing countries\n",
    "(mostly in China, and also in Mexico, India and Indonesia) are\n",
    "overwhelming them in developed countries. Instead, the net export\n",
    "effects in developed countries are greater than developing countries.\n",
    "This result highlights the current economic development situations\n",
    "in developed and developing countries. For those developed countries, such as the United States, the imports are usually high, which\n",
    "induces the lower net export values than those developing countries\n",
    "such as China. As for the investment, the economic growth is\n",
    "consumption-led, instead of investment-led in developed countries.\n",
    "However, the economic growth in developing countries is mainly\n",
    "driven by large-scale investment and infrastructure construction.\n",
    "For example, the consumption in the United States accounted for\n",
    "nearly 65%, whereas the investment only contributed to 15% of\n",
    "gross domestic output. That is why the drivers are signiﬁcantly\n",
    "different in different countries.\n",
    "Compared to CO2 emissions, the total volumes of other two kinds of\n",
    "GHG emissions are relative low. When summing up total effects of three\n",
    "periods, there is an increase of 40.62 Mt. in CH4 emissions, and only\n",
    "1.24 Mt. in N2O emissions from 1995 to 2009. Still, the emission\n",
    "intensity effects greatly contributed to the emission reductions of\n",

    "results at industry-level are demonstrated in Fig. 2.\n",
    "It is greatly acknowledged that the atmospheric manmade CO2\n",
    "emissions mainly come from fossil fuel combustion, industrial production, human and animal respiration, land vegetation destruction and\n",
    "organism combustion (Wang ‘., 2014; Zakarya ‘., 2015;\n",
    "Krapivin ‘., 2017). Among these causes, fuel combustion and\n",
    "industrial production contributed greatly to CO2 emissions Thus,\n",
    "SEC16 (Electricity, Gas and Water Supply) contributed the most to the\n",
    "growth of CO2 emissions,4 followed by SEC10 (Manufacture of other\n",
    "non-metallic mineral products), SEC11 (Basic Metals and Fabricated\n",
    "Metal), SEC02 (Mining and quarrying) and SEC21 (Land transport and\n",
    "transport via pipelines). The wholesale and retail trade (SEC 19&20)\n",
    "are two sectors that contributed the most to CO2 emission reduction.\n",
    "CH4 is often regarded as the second most important GHG after CO2.\n",
    "IPCC report revealed that the global warming potential of CH4 is 25\n",
    "times more than CO2 (IPCC, 2007). The main source of atmospheric\n",
    "CH4 is the biosphere. Evidences showed that the main biological sources\n",
    "of atmospheric CH4 related to human beings are mainly rice ﬁelds\n",
    "and herbivorous livestock (Abbasi ‘., 2016). Abiotic sources of\n",
    "atmospheric CH4 are mainly the various combustion processes of the\n",
    "organism and the emission of petroleum, natural gas and coal mines.\n",
    "Thus, SEC01 (Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing) and SEC02\n",

    "Su ‘. (2010) is the ﬁrst study looking into the impact of sector aggregation in environmental input-output analysis and advocate a higher level of sector disaggregation is\n",

    "‘. (2015). Su and Ang (2012b) investigated analytically the possible effects of sector aggregation on the study results.\n",

    "The results show that sectoral emission efﬁciency improvement was the main contributor to the slight decrease in global emission intensity. In China, India and United States,\n",

    "(Wang ‘., 2017b).\n",

    "nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms. Due to the widely use of\n",
    "fertilizers, fertilization of farmland also become an important manmade source of N2O. Then, SEC08 (Chemicals and Chemical Products),\n",
    "which includes manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen\n",
    "compounds also can produce non-negligible N2O. Undoubtedly, the\n",
    "production process of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds will lead to\n",
    "N2O emissions. Besides, the combustion processes of fossil fuels also\n",
    "can cause the emissions of N2O. Thus, in the electric power industry, especially coal-ﬁred power plants, the emissions of the contaminants such\n",
    "as N2O are still rising.\n",
    "The results in Fig. 2 perfectly veriﬁed the above statements. For example, from 2000 to 2009, there was an increase of 2559.8 Mt. in CO2\n",
    "emissions caused by SEC16 (Electricity, Gas and Water Supply), which\n",
    "accounted for 58.22% of total CO2 emission growth. Although the emission intensity effects contributed to emission reduction by a large margin, it cannot make up for the increase of CO2 emissions caused by\n",
    "economic expansion. The consumption-led and investment-led CO2\n",
    "emission growth in SEC16 reached 5810.1 and 3160.2 Mt. respectively,\n",
    "larger than 6908.4 Mt. of emission reductions caused by the declining\n",

    "Although industrial and urban emissions constitute the main causes\n",
    "of GHG emissions, with the development of rural urbanization and\n",

    "growing. Meanwhile, N2O and CH4 emissions, which are highly related\n",
    "to agriculture sectors, are increasing signiﬁcantly.\n",
    "There was an increase of 1393.4 Mt. in N2O emissions caused by agricultural production activities, accounting for 99.2% of total N2O emission growth. The growth of CH4 emissions caused by agricultural\n",
    "production activities and mining activities accounted for 38.1% and\n",
    "48.3% of total CH4 emission growth respectively. Note that, different\n",
    "emission characteristics are determined by different industrial characteristics. In SEC02, the investment-led emission growth is signiﬁcantly\n",

    "N2O emissions changes are negative. Conversely, in developing countries, such as Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia, the total effects are positive,\n",

    "countries.\n",
    "The contribution of different effects on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions\n",

    "As the main greenhouse gas, the world has wit-\n",
    "nessed rapidly increasing carbon dioxide (CO)\n",
    "emissions in the past few decades (Dong ‘.\n",
    "2018a). The statistics from BP (formerly British\n",
    "Petroleum) are clear to support this. The global\n",
    "CO, emissions have increased dramatically, by\n",
    "approximately twofold, from 21,571.7 million tons\n",
    "in 1990 to 33,472.0 million tons in 2014, with an\n",
    "annual average rate of 1.8% (BP 2017). The rapidly\n",

    "spects and implications of renewable energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously, the last few decades have witnessed\n",
    "rapidly rising renewable energy consumption\n",
    "across the globe. From the statistics from BP\n",
    "(2017), the global renewable energy consumption\n",
    "has increased from 514.7 million tonnes oil equiva-\n",
    "lent (Mtoe) in 1990 to 1,196.6 Mtoe in 2014.\n",
    "Furthermore, according to the World Energy\n",

    "have investigated the role of renewable energy in\n",

    "\n",
    "At the country-specific level, in the case of Italy,\n",
    "Bento and Moutinho (2016) find CO, emissions\n",
    "are related to renewable electricity production in\n",
    "the long run but not vice versa. By employing the\n",
    "vector error correction model (VECM) Granger\n",
    "causality technique, Bélaid and Youssef (2017)\n",
    "indicate that renewable energy has a beneficial\n",
    "environmental effect in Algeria. This viewpoint is\n",
    "also confirmed by Dong, Sun, and Dong (2018b),\n",
    "2018c), who conclude that renewable energy con-\n",
    "sumption can reduce CO, emissions in China.\n",
    "Similarly, results obtained by Chen, Wang, and\n",
    "Zhong (2019) reveal that China’s renewable\n",
    "energy consumption has a negative impact on\n",
    "CO, emissions in the long-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the regional level, for the case of the European\n",
    "Union (EU), Dogan and Seker (2016) identify\n",
    "a bidirectional causal relationship between CO,\n",
    "emissions and renewable energy consumption,\n",
    "implying that renewable energy consumption can\n",
    "significantly influence CO, emissions and vice\n",
    "versa. By employing the VECM panel Granger caus-\n",
    "ality approach, Dong, Sun, and Hochman (2017a)\n",
    "conclude that renewable energy consumption sub-\n",
    "stantially mitigates CO2 emissions for a panel of\n",
    "BRICS countries (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, China,\n",
    "and South Africa). Similarly, for a panel of EU-5\n",
    "countries (ie, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and\n",
    "the United Kingdom), Balsalobre-Lorente ‘.\n",
    "(2018) indicate that renewable electricity consump-\n",

    "(2019), and several other studies have investigated\n",

    "3.2. CD and CIPS test\n",
    "Initially, we ﬁnd that whether the data we have taken has the\n",
    "characteristic of cross-sectional independence or dependence.\n",
    "Pesaran's [25] cross-sectional dependence test is use to fulﬁll this\n",
    "purpose. This is the major issue which needs to be solved before\n",
    "approaching to panel unit root test. The old unit root test has low\n",
    "power and is not effective when they are used on the panel series\n",
    "which already has a cross-sectional dependence issue [26,27].\n",
    "Consequently, in present study, we employ Pesaran [28] CIPS unit\n",
    "root test which is based on the hypothesis of cross-sectional\n",
    "dependence. This panel unit root test is the essential for the\n",
    "panel cointegration models. This test is used to examine the order\n",
    "of incorporation of the variables. If entire variables are integrated of\n",
    "the equal level i.e. I (1), then this is an indication that entire of the\n",
    "data set has a unit root problem at level and are stationary at ﬁrst\n",
    "difference. So, it can be concluded all the variables in the data set\n",
    "may have a relationship in long-run equilibrium.\n",
    "3.3. Panel cointegration technique\n",
    "In the current study, we apply bootstrap panel cointegration\n",
    "proposed by Westerlund [29] to examine the long-run relationship\n",
    "between the variables throughout the complete sample of 74\n",
    "economies. This analysis is more beneﬁcial if the time series\n",
    "component of every cross-section is smaller. Owing to these features research scholars have newly adopting the bootstrapping\n",
    "panel cointegration technique to investigate the long run relationship between the variables [30]. The old traditional techniques\n",
    "have accepted the null hypothesis of no cointegration even in case\n",
    "where cointegration is strongly proposed by theories. Irrespective\n",
    "of traditional techniques, Westerlund [29] has newly established a\n",
    "recent panel cointegration test focused on structural instead of\n",
    "residual dynamics. The outcomes disclose that these tests have\n",
    "restricting normal distributions and they are more reliable in term\n",
    "of consistency. Westerlund [29] explains that the outcome of the\n",
    "new test give decent size accuracy and are extra powerful than the\n",
    "residual based tests by Pedroni [31e33]. Based on this evidence,\n",
    "current study will analyze the effect of renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption on environmental degradation.\n",
    "This study employs the panel co-integration test. This test was\n",
    "proposed by Westerlund [29] and Persyn and Westerlund [34]. The\n",
    "hypothesis of cointegration is evaluated by using the two different\n",
    "tests (i) group mean test and (ii) panel test. Based on the Error\n",
    "Correction Model, Westerlund [29] develop four test statistics, Ga,\n",
    "Gt, Pa, and Pt and all these four statistics are normally distributed.\n",
    "The Gt, Pt are calculated in the standard way, by using the standard\n",
    "error parameters of the Error Correction model. Whereas, Ga and Pa\n",
    "are based on the standard errors given by Newey and West [35];\n",
    "which are adjusted from autocorrelations and heteroskedasticity.\n",
    "In order to run this test, all the variables are assumed to be\n",
    "stationary at ﬁrst difference I (1). This test evaluates the absence of\n",
    "co-integration by determining whether error correction is present\n",
    "for the whole group and also in individual panel members. On the\n",
    "basis of the existence of cointegration, the long-run parameters are\n",
    "estimated. In a cross-sectional analysis, the error variance varies\n",
    "across the groups which affect the consistency of the estimators. To\n",
    "overcome this issue the generalized least squares method (GLS) can\n",
    "be used. But the variance variability still exists, such as the correlation of the squared residuals with the regressors in each group.\n",
    "Within the group, there are two sources which cause the\n",
    "\n",
    "heteroskedasticity problem, it could either by differences in the\n",
    "variance of the residual terms conditioned on the regressors or by\n",
    "differences in the unconditional variance of the residual terms. So,\n",
    "in order to control both the sources causing the heteroskedasticity,\n",
    "the fully modiﬁed ordinary least square (FMOLS) is used.\n",
    "3.4. Long-run elasticities\n",
    "Based on panel data set, the use of ordinary least square (OLS) is\n",
    "considered to bias and its distribution focus upon an annoyance\n",
    "constraint. Pedroni [31,32] reasons that in the case of regression\n",
    "result, annoyance constraints could result for the existence of\n",
    "endogeneity and serial correlation issue between the regressors. So,\n",
    "to solve these problems, we apply the FMOLS model. This technique\n",
    "focuses on the nonparametric method in order to resolve the issue\n",
    "of serial correlation and endogeneity. Therefore, we use FMOLS\n",
    "technique to examine the long-run equilibrium relationship.\n",
    "3.5. Heterogeneous panel causality test\n",
    "We investigate the short-run bivariate causal relationship between the variables by selecting a framework that supports the\n",
    "heterogeneity of the models throughout the cross sections. This\n",
    "panel causality technique has been introduced by Dumitrescu and\n",
    "Hurlin [36]. This technique is suitable for stationary data by using\n",
    "the ﬁxed coefﬁcients in the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. The\n",
    "implication of this approach is that it taking different log structure\n",
    "and similarly heterogeneous measurement throughout the crosssection under both assumptions. Firstly, the null hypothesis of no\n",
    "causal relationship is testing and then alternative hypothesis for\n",
    "testing the causal relationship at least for few cross sections. Finally,\n",
    "the Wald statistics are computed to each of the cross sections\n",
    "individually for testing Granger noncausality. Dumitrescu and\n",
    "Hurlin [36] reason that this panel causality test meets to a normal\n",
    "distribution in homogeneous noncausality hypothesis when T indicates to inﬁnity ﬁst and then N represents to inﬁnity.\n",
    "4. Data analysis and ﬁndings\n",
    "4.1. The cross-sectional dependence and unit root tests\n",
    "Table 1 explains the outcomes for the CD test and CIPS unit root\n",
    "test. The CD test outcomes for the most carbon emission countries\n",
    "show that the rejection of the null hypothesis of cross section independence at the 1% level of signiﬁcance for all variables, signifying indication of cross-sectional dependence. We used newly\n",
    "established CIPS unit root test instead of conventional methods of\n",
    "unit root test. This test discusses for cross-sectional dependence in\n",
    "the data series. The outcomes of the CIPS unit root test show that\n",
    "the rejection of the null hypothesis for all variables at ﬁrst order\n",

    "Based on the current results, it can be recommended that government of high carbon emission countries need to expand international and national strategies to not simply deal environmental\n",

    "estimation approach which is only beginning to be explored in\n",
    "published economic growth, fossil fuel energy consumption, carbon emissions and oil price nexus literature. The PMG panel ARDL\n",

    "through the short-term parameters and facilitates both long-run\n",
    "and short-run causalities inferences to be drawn, regardless of\n",
    "whether the variables used are integrated of order one or zero (I(1)\n",
    "or I(0)). Previous applications of the PMG panel ARDL approach in\n",
    "other areas of research include Iwata ‘. (2011) for an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), Bangake and Eggoh (2012) for capital\n",
    "mobility and Asafu-Adjaye ‘. (2016) for income-energy nexus.\n",

    "methods which assumes that panel times series data are homogeneous and cross-sectionally independent. Disregarding the existence of cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across the\n",

    "since they are by-products of industrial process, consumption of\n",
    "energy (fossil fuel and electricity) and the use of automobile. As a\n",

    "many African nations since they heavily rely on natural resources as\n",

    "addition, energy consumption together with carbon emissions in\n",
    "African countries increase as income (economic growth) increases.\n",
    "As the level of income increases, nations have the mean to implement costly environmental schemes leading to the reduction in\n",

    "carbon emission with reference to Table 3 were not highly correlated hence both variables did not exhibit any issue of collinearity\n",
    "and endogeneity.\n",
    "Energy use particularly is an important determinant of economic growth. This is due to the fact that, four competing propositions of energy use and economic growth are identiﬁed. For\n",
    "instance, reductions in energy use would not have adverse effect on\n",
    "economic growth if economic growth causes energy use. If a twoway causality is found between both variables or energy use causes economic growth then new sources of energy should be\n",
    "encouraged. Energy is an important impetus of production process\n",
    "thus the use of energy causes economic growth. An expansion in\n",
    "production is linked with demand of energy and economic growth\n",
    "which might cause the use of energy.\n",

    "of economic growth in African economies with increase of its\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "demand. Due to this prices of oil are doing their main contributions\n",
    "to impact GDP in African nations. According to Energy Information\n",
    "Administration (IEA), economic performance remains highly\n",
    "correlated with oil prices (IEA, 2006). For, most developing countries of which African countries are not exceptional, oil prices accounts for large portion of GDP. Signiﬁcant increase in oil price\n",
    "therefore will lead to a considerable rise in production and transportation cost for many industries, which at the same time affects\n",
    "economic growth.\n",
    "The aforementioned reasons discussed therefore justiﬁes the\n",
    "inclusion of the energy consumption, carbon emission and oil price\n",
    "as variables assumed to have impact on economic growth of African\n",
    "nations.\n",
    "Among the variables contained in the model from Equation (5),\n",
    "Yit ; OPit ; FEit ; CO2it and Lit are obtained directly from the database\n",

    "studies used gross capital formation (GKF) as a substitute of Kit , but\n",
    "deﬁned as the use of investment rather than physical capital stock.\n",
    "The study therefore endeavors to calculate physical capital stock\n",
    "pertaining to individual countries within the panel.\n",
    "Assuming the depreciation rate remains unchanged, the perpetual inventory technique developed by OECD (2009) can be used\n",
    "to obtain Kit by accruing gross capital formation. Suppose that the\n",

    "panel of 22 African countries with two sub-samples (oil exporters\n",

    "interest in one country are likely to affect a similar variable in other\n",
    "regional economies. Our ﬁndings per the existence of slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence are generally in line\n",
    "with that of Dogan and Aslan (2017) with respect to carbon emissions, energy use and economic growth in EU and candidate\n",

    "\n",
    "consumption (fossil fuel) is a key component for promoting economic growth; hence reduction in the rate of energy consumption\n",

    "carbon emissions associated with increased usage of coal, oil, fertilizers and other energy-intensive fossil fuel resources. These resources according to Asafu-Adjaye ‘. (2016), are inputs in\n",
    "industrial and agricultural production, which, if increased in use,\n",

    "African countries, this coalition could be as a result of high patterns\n",

    "negative effect on economic growth among seven sampled countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, another unilateral cause-andeffect relationship was found running from oil price to use of energy\n",
    "(fossil fuel) also for all panels also suggesting that rise in price of oil\n",
    "creates economic conditions in African countries which enable more\n",
    "energy (fossil fuel) to be consumed leading to high carbon emissions. This ﬁnding is generally consistent with the ﬁndings of Nwani\n",
    "(2017) in the case of Ecuador but contrary to the studies of Belaid\n",
    "(2013) who suggested the absence of causal relationship between\n",
    "oil price and use of energy in Algeria.\n",
    "Interestingly, economic growth, energy consumption, carbon\n",
    "emissions and oil price were found across all panels to respond\n",
    "speedily to deviances in the long-term equilibrium. This is generally\n",

    "short term. Therefore, the question quales on why the difference of\n",
    "these variables in engagement with the long-term case and shortterm case. First of all, the difference in the effects on long and short\n",
    "terms comes from the accumulation of the variables overtime\n",
    "which cross marks differences in the long and short terms. These\n",
    "variables are quite very weighty in density and so absorb a lot as a\n",

    "becomes too packed up for extreme case of industrial needs which\n",

    "Besides the aforementioned underlying factors, political balance/\n",
    "unbalance creates a lot of spaces for effects of these variables to the\n",

    "in the long and short term interaction. It is never kwon how balance\n",

    "5. Conclusions and policy recommendations\n",
    "This study looked at the causal link amid economic growth (real\n",
    "GDP), consumption of energy (fossil fuel), carbon emissions and oil\n",
    "price for 22 African countries between 1990 and 2015. The countries used in this study were analysed as a whole panel and subdivided into sub-panels namely; Oil exporting and Non-oil\n",
    "exporting African economies. In summary the conclusion based\n",
    "on the ﬁndings of this study are summarized as follows: First, by\n",
    "looking at the results from the Pesaran-Yamagata homogeneity test\n",
    "for each panel and applying the Pesaran CD's tests as well to the\n",
    "panel time series data, we detect the presence of heterogeneity and\n",
    "cross-sectional correlations for the analysed data. Second, the CADF\n",
    "and CIPS panel unit root tests report that, the analysed variables are\n",
    "non-stationary at their levels but become stationary at their ﬁrst\n",
    "differences. Third, the Westerlund-Edgerton panel bootstrap cointegration test show that, the analysed variables are cointegrated\n",
    "and hence possess a structural long-run relationship. Forth, results\n",
    "from the PMG estimator through the panel ARDL model show that;\n",
    "(1) A bidirectional causality is ﬂanked by energy use (fossil fuel)\n",
    "and carbon emissions in the long-and short-terms for all panels; (2)\n",
    "A positive and signiﬁcant unidirectional cause eand eeffect relationship from carbon emissions to economic growth in the longand short-run for Non-oil exporting countries whilst a bidirectional causality only in the long-run for oil exporters are evidenced;\n",
    "(3) A bilateral causal link is evidenced amid energy use (fossil fuel)\n",
    "and carbon emission both in the long and short-terms for all\n",
    "panels; (4) A positive and unidirectional causality running from oil\n",
    "price to economic growth is found across all panels for both long\n",
    "and short-terms; (5) The PMG estimator through the panel ARDL\n",
    "framework is evidenced to be very signiﬁcantly effective to the\n",
    "application of PVCEM granger causality test. Though difference\n",
    "parameter estimates is evidenced, the results is generally consistent with that of the PMG in terms of causalities.\n",
    "Empirical ﬁndings from this study provide more information, in\n",
    "order to understand the relationship amid the analysed variables\n",
    "and will also help policymakers to set policies based on the analysed variables. These empirical ﬁndings have some policy recommendations discussed in a step by step manner as follows;\n",
    "(1) First, short-term and long-term causalities from the PMG\n",
    "estimation through ARDL model revealed a bilateral causal\n",
    "link ﬂanked by consumption of energy (fossil fuel) and carbon emissions. This depicts that, consumption of energy and\n",
    "emissions of carbon are interrelated in the sense that, increase in energy consumption leads to high carbon emissions, whiles the increase in carbon emissions indicates more\n",
    "consumption of energy. Thus as energy consumption increases, policymakers in Africa should develop policies to\n",
    "reduce the high amount of carbon that is likely to be emitted.\n",
    "A very effective alternative is for these policymakers to ﬁnetune the consumption of energy (fossil fuel) by amassing the\n",
    "utilization of clean energy, for example, natural gas, hydropower just to mention a few.\n",
    "(2) Secondly, a bilateral causal relationship amid consumption of\n",
    "energy (fossil fuel) and economic growth (GDP) has also been\n",
    "observed in both long and short-terms for all panels. This\n",
    "means that as energy consumption continues to be a vital\n",

    " \n",
    "172\n",
    "\n",
    "I.A. Mensah ‘. / Journal of Cleaner Production 228 (2019) 161e174\n",
    "\n",
    "component for growth of African economy, increase in economic growth as well will imply a high rate of energy consumption. There is, therefore, a belief that, direct measures to\n",
    "safeguard energy may be detrimental to the growth of African economy, irrespective of whether the country produces\n",
    "oil or not or the stage of development of the economy. It is\n",
    "therefore necessary that, in regards to formulating policies\n",
    "on the conservation of energy, the potential harmful effects\n",
    "on energy conservation should be considered. Also, since\n",
    "energy consumption leads to a high rate of emissions and\n",
    "also promotes economic growth, climates change policies, as\n",
    "a result, should be targeted at. This can be done by boosting\n",
    "the consumption of non-renewable energy such as biofuel,\n",
    "hydropower, biogas, biodiesel just to mention a few and also\n",
    "reﬁning the efﬁciency of energy until the fossil fuel energy\n",
    "consumption is reduced without any hindrance to the\n",
    "growth of African economy.\n",
    "(3) In addition, empirical ﬁndings from this study showed evidence of a positive unilateral causal relationship both in\n",
    "long-term and short-term from carbon emissions to economic growth for non-oil exporting African countries whilst\n",
    "a bilateral causality between these variables was identiﬁed\n",
    "only in long-terms for oil exporting economies in Africa. The\n",
    "results depict that, for non-oil exporting African economies,\n",
    "with increasing economic output, carbon emissions generally do not decline in a long or short period of time, hence\n",
    "reducing carbon emission increments rather than reducing\n",
    "the entire amount of carbon emissions must, therefore, be an\n",
    "attainable goal for non-oil exporting African economies.\n",
    "(4) Also for oil exporting African countries, based on the bidirectional causality, increase in economic growth undoubtedly will signiﬁcantly increase carbon emissions and vice\n",
    "versa in the long-run. An unexpected fall in the emission of\n",
    "carbon therefore, on the contrary is likely to decline economic growth. Hence stability of such a relationship will\n",
    "seriously become a problem because the growth of the\n",
    "economy of oil exporting countries with high emissions of\n",
    "\n",
    "carbon is dangerous to the environment as well as development. Policy makers in such countries in Africa (Oil\n",
    "exporting countries) therefore need to develop policies that\n",
    "can support carbon and energy management in order to\n",
    "develop efﬁciency with respect to use of energy and also\n",
    "minimize rates of carbon emissions.\n",
    "(5) Interestingly, our results suggest once again that, there is a\n",
    "positive and signiﬁcant unilateral cause-and-effect connection from oil price to economic growth (real GDP) in short\n",
    "and long terms for all panels used. This ﬁnding gives the\n",
    "implication that African economies (oil exporting and nonoil exporting African economies) are able to generate high\n",
    "income (revenue) from rising oil prices, leading to the\n",
    "growth of the economy. It is, therefore, necessary to develop\n",
    "procedures that would help maintain high oil prices and\n",
    "stability on the world market in order to achieve a sustained\n",
    "economic development through foreign exchange. Paramount ﬂuctuations in oil prices, particularly reduction in oil\n",
    "prices on the international market is likely to have a negative\n",
    "impact on economic growth of African countries leading to\n",
    "economic hardships.\n",

    "However, the speed of urbanization is observed to have been faster in\n",
    "developing countries than in the developed world (Sadorsky, 2014;\n",
    "Shahbaz ‘., 2016). Economies around the world have also become\n",
    "more globalized than ever before. Especially, during the last two decades,\n",
    "there have been a significant level of growth in the volumes of interna-\n",
    "tional trade and nations seemed to be increasingly integrated with the\n",
    "rest of the world. This is more evident when we observe that an economic\n",
    "earthquake in one part of the world immediately shakes the economies\n",
    "on the other side of the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Globalization has generated increasing level of interdependence\n",
    "among national economies. This has also turned around the political\n",
    "dynamics of the world. Many historical foes turned into friends or at least\n",

    "South Africa is undisputedly the most urbanized and the most glob-\n",
    "alized economy in Sub-Saharan Africa region (SSA). It underwent a\n",
    "steady urbanization process during the last three decades. Its urbaniza-\n",

    "Globally, South Africa is the 14th largest CO2 emitter and one of the\n",

    "(Wang and Dong, 2019). Since it is a signatory to the 1992 UNFCCC and\n",

    "Despite the fact that South Africa has been pursuing various energy\n",
    "policies in order to enhance the concentration of renewable energy in its\n",
    "national energy composition for sometime now, 77% of its energy needs\n",

    "level of carbon emissions. The study is expected to be an enrichment of\n",
    "the literature on urbanization-globalization-emissions nexus. Another\n",
    "contribution of this study is that unlike most of the empirical studies, the\n",
    "current research uses a recently developed globalization index instead of\n",
    "the traditional measure of trade openness. Thus, this empirical exercise is\n",
    "a contribution to the scanty literature of globalization that used this\n",

    "an end in section 5 offering discussions, conclusions and policy\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Three theories: ecological modernization theory, urban environ-\n",
    "mental transition theory and compact city theory have explained the\n",
    "theoretical link between urbanization and environment (Poumanyvong\n",
    "and Kaneko, 2010). The ecological modernization theory is based on the\n",
    "premise that as an economy grows, the level of associated environmental\n",
    "damage at some point can't be ignored. It becomes imperative for econ-\n",
    "omies to undertake measures such as, promoting technological\n",
    "advancement and well-planned urbanization. The theory also empha-\n",
    "sizes the need for a transition from a manufacture-based economy to a\n",
    "service-based economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban environmental transition theory suggests that emissions effect\n",
    "of urbanization is rather ambiguous. One line of thought offers a couple\n",
    "of arguments in favor of urbanization’'s role to stimulate emissions. The\n",
    "first argument sheds light on the fact that urban cities are generally\n",
    "characterized by industrialization that causes emissions while the other\n",
    "one supports the view that the consumption pattern of urbanites is\n",
    "generally more carbon intensive than their rural counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line of thought generated from this theory is that, since\n",
    "urban people are relatively wealthier and more concerned about climate\n",
    "issues, various measures for a decline in pollution may be developed and\n",
    "implemented. One such measure is to enforce and increase the level of\n",
    "compliance with environmental regulations. More financial resources\n",
    "should be channeled towards exploiting emissions abatement potentials.\n",
    "Higher investment in modern technology is also important for achieving\n",
    "desired level of energy efficiency. The compact city theory underscores\n",
    "the importance of economies of scale that could be achieved through\n",
    "increased urbanization resulting in the potential expansion of public\n",
    "infrastructure such as water supply, health facilities, education and\n",
    "transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two strands of empirical literature continue to evolve on COz\n",
    "emissions-urbanization nexus. The first strand deals with time series\n",
    "country-specific studies while the other one is devoted to panel studies\n",
    "that included mostly countries of different regions. Ali ‘. (2019) in\n",
    "one of the most recent studies probed the effect of urbanization on CO2\n",
    "emissions for Pakistan using time series data for the period 1972-2014.\n",
    "Through the application of ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag)\n",
    "method, the study found that urbanization stimulated emissions in\n",
    "Pakistan both in the short-run and the long-run. Urbanization was also\n",
    "found to cause emissions in the short-run. The study offered the argu-\n",
    "ment that one of the key contributing factors towards such a dismal\n",
    "emissions scenario in Pakistan is vehicular emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wang ‘. (2019) undertook an interesting study to investigate the\n",
    "quality of urbanization on COz emissions across different provinces in\n",
    "China. Using a geographically weighted regression model (GWR), the\n",
    "study observed heterogeneous effects of urbanization on emissions\n",
    "across different provinces. The study recommends that urban sprawling\n",
    "would be environmentally very expensive unless it is accompanied by\n",
    "province-specific environmental policies. Liu and Bae (2018) investi-\n",
    "gated the impacts of urbanization, industrialization, economic growth\n",
    "and energy consumption on COz emissions in the context of China. The\n",
    "study analyzed time series data for the period 1970-2015 with the\n",
    "application of ARDL method and VECM (Vector Error Correction\n",
    "Model) to estimate short-run and long-run coefficients and the causal\n",
    "direction among the variables. Empirical results indicated that all\n",
    "explanatory variables including urbanization stimulated CO2 emissions\n",
    "in China.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploiting census data for the period of 1901-2011 for India, Franco\n",
    "‘. (2017) probed the temporal, dynamic and causal link between\n",
    " \n",
    "M. Salahuddin ‘.\n",
    "\n",
    "urbanization and CO, emissions. Findings indicated that rapid urbani-\n",
    "zation in India has caused a faster rise in emissions. A number of rec-\n",
    "ommendations have been offered for more effective emissions-reduction\n",
    "measures. Bekhet and Othman (2017) studied the impact of urbanization\n",
    "on COz emissions for Malaysia and analyzed time series data for Malaysia\n",
    "for the period 1971-2015 within an augmented Cobb-Douglas produc-\n",
    "tion function. The study found a U-shaped relationship between urban-\n",
    "ization and COz emissions in the long-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding is consistent with another earlier study for the same\n",
    "country by Shahbaz ‘. (2016) who utilized time series quarterly data\n",
    "for the period 1970Q1-201104. Using a STIRPAT model and through the\n",
    "application of ARDL method, the study found a U-shaped relation be-\n",
    "tween urbanization and CO2 emissions. Urbanization is also reported to\n",
    "have Granger-caused emissions as evident from VECM Granger causality\n",
    "test. This U-shaped relation between urbanization and CO emissions has\n",
    "been corroborated by earlier findings of Zhang ‘. (2015) which also\n",
    "exploited time series data for Beijing, the capital of China for the period\n",
    "1980-2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous panel studies have also studied the effects of urbanization\n",
    "on CO, emissions (Chen ‘., 2019; Bai ‘., 2019; Wang ‘., 2018;\n",
    "Lin ‘., 2017; Li ‘., 2018; Zhang ‘., 2017; Rafiq ‘., 2016;\n",
    "Wang ‘., 2016; Li and Lin, 2015; Sadorsky, 2013; Sadorsky, 2014;\n",
    "Poumanyvong and Kaneko, 2010; Sharma, 2011 among others). How-\n",
    "ever, no unique effect is unanimously observed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two opposing theoretical views exist in literature with regards to the\n",
    "potential environmental effects of globalization-induced trade openness:\n",
    "the “pollution haven’ hypothesis (Eskeland and Harrison, 2003) and the\n",
    "“California effect’? hypothesis (Vogel, 1995). The “pollution haven’\n",
    "argument suggests that trade openness potentially causes relocation of\n",
    "industries from developed countries to developing countries. As a\n",
    "consequence of a higher level of trade openness, high polluting industries\n",
    "from developed countries tend to avoid pollution tax by being relocated\n",
    "to pollution havens in developing countries with relatively flexible\n",
    "environmental regulations. These relocated industries aim to reduce\n",
    "production costs. This is how pollution in developing countries is likely to\n",
    "rise as a result of industry flight (Jaffe ‘., 1995).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another camp of scholars focus on the positive effects of trade on\n",
    "pollution in developing countries. Levinson (2010) analysis of US im-\n",
    "ports for the period 1972-2001 is in contrast with the pollution haven\n",
    "hypothesis. Scholars suggest that the cost savings generated from the\n",
    "relocation of firms to developing countries (pollution havens) are often\n",
    "outweighed by loss in reputation back in the country of origin. Firms\n",
    "importing from developing countries are likely to face growing pressure\n",
    "from their home countries to ensure environmental protection for the\n",
    "exporting countries (Prakash and Potoski, 2007). Thus, trade can be\n",
    "instrumental for boosting environmental standard of imported goods\n",
    "entering into the developed countries as exports from the developing\n",
    "countries. Thus developing countries may achieve a higher environ-\n",
    "mental standard in their key exports as a result of trade openness (Perkins\n",
    "and Neumayer, 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some recent panel studies (e.g., Lv and Xu, 2018; Le ‘., 2016; Li\n",
    "‘., 2015; Lim’., 2015; Jorgenson and Givens, 2014) have exploited\n",

    "South Africa is the most urbanized and the most globalized country in\n",

    "world. Despite many good achievements on the economic front since the\n",
    "debacle of apartheid almost three decades back, South Africa is still\n",
    "struggling with high levels of income inequality, corruption, poverty, and\n",
    "climate change risk. The literature on urbanization and globalization\n",
    "reveal how these two factors have been linked to environmental con-\n",
    "cerns. In the light of this background, this study analyses time series data\n",
    "of South Africa (1984-2017) in order to examine the effects of urbani-\n",
    "zation, globalization, economic growth and energy poverty on COz\n",
    "emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After detecting structural breaks through Zivot and Andrews and Bai\n",
    "and Perron unit root tests, this study applied ARDL estimation technique\n",
    "to first of all, assess cointegration and then estimate the short run and\n",
    "long-run coefficients on the relevant variables. Toda-Yamamoto causality\n",
    "test and variance decomposition analysis were also performed on the\n",
    "data. Findings suggest that urbanization stimulates COz emissions both in\n",
    "the short-run and the long-run. A bi-directional causal link between ur-\n",
    "banization and CO2 emissions is also reported. Although, no causal effect\n",
    "between globalization and COz emissions is reported, globalization is\n",
    "observed to negatively affect CO2 emissions in the long run as evident\n",
    "from its significant long-run coefficient from ARDL estimates. Both eco-\n",
    "nomic growth and energy poverty cause COz emissions regardless of their\n",

    "To the extent that the G7 countries are among the largest economies\n",
    "in terms of their economic size, financial sector, trade openness and\n",
    "attractive destinations of FDI as well as the most politically influential\n",
    "countries, our study focuses on their environmental impact on the global\n",
    "scale. In particular, we attempt to empirically investigate the dynamic\n",
    "patterns of their carbon emissions and the factors influencing their\n",
    "emissions. Our main contributions are therefore threefold. First, we\n",
    "propose a comprehensive approach to examine the explanatory power of\n",
    "important economic factors (economic growth, financial development,\n",
    "international trade openness, and FDI) in determining carbon emissions\n",
    "in the G6 countries (excluding Germany as this country does not have\n",
    "unified dataset before 1991). Our argument, which reinforces past\n",
    "studies, is that economic and financial development as well as FDI and\n",
    "trading relations of these countries have significant ecological conse­\n",
    "quences. The robustness of our empirical findings is also explored\n",
    "thoroughly by using a set of econometric approaches. Second, we\n",
    "attempt to forecast carbon emissions of the underlying countries based\n",
    "on their identified determinants. This forecasting exercise is important\n",
    "as it facilitates the formulation of forward-looking public policies to\n",
    "tackle climate change. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\n",
    "study to investigate how the underlying factors affect forecasting the\n",
    "amount of carbon emission in these economies. Third, our study con­\n",
    "textualises the debate on financial development and its ecological con­\n",
    "sequences for the case of six most advanced economies (G6) in the\n",
    "world, which have been a focus of many studies over the last two de­\n",
    "cades and whose policy lessons could be used for emerging and devel­\n",
    "oping economies in their path of development. Looking at the\n",
    "environmental degradation in these important countries sheds light on\n",
    "how they committed to environmental preservation and protection. The\n",
    "choice of sample countries is equally motivated by the fact that they\n",
    "have well developed financial sectors, are widely open to international\n",
    "trade, and maintain a higher level of attractiveness for foreign direct\n",
    "investment. Moreover, within the G6 economies, the United States,\n",
    "Japan and Canada are among the top CO2 emitters.\n",
    "Drawing and contextualising on the existing evidence, we briefly\n",
    "review the nexus between emissions and its potential four determinants\n",
    "including, growth, financial development, FDI and trade openness. A\n",
    "reasonable rate of economic growth is one of the core objectives of\n",
    "economic policymaking. However, the economic growth has environ­\n",
    "mental implications and the future economic growth may come at the\n",
    "cost of environmental degradation in the G6 countries which already\n",
    "have quite high levels of aggregate GHG emissions. The growthemissions nexus is often seen through the lens of Environmental Kuz­\n",
    "nets Curve (EKC) showing an inverted U-shaped association between the\n",
    "growth of an economy and the degradation of its environment. There is\n",

    "very often it is postulated that the economic growth can improve the\n",

    "tion is only a short-run issue. As the countries achieve higher income\n",
    "levels, economic growth starts to play rather a positive role in envi­\n",

    "Krueger (1991) and Shafik (1994) which theorised and provided foun­\n",
    "dations to the EKC framework, a number of empirical studies focusing\n",
    "on EKC have reported contrasting results across both individual country\n",
    "and group of countries samples (e.g., Onafowora and Owoye, 2014;\n",
    "Baek, 2015; Apergis, 2016; Al-Mulali and Ozturk, 2016; Özokcu and\n",
    "Özdemir, 2017; Shahbaz ‘., 2018; Nasir ‘., 2019; Pham ‘.,\n",
    "2020). For instance, Shahbaz ‘. (2018) argued that the presence of\n",
    "EKC depends on the development stage of a country. Similarly, a study\n",
    "by Özokcu and Özdemir (2017) on 26 OECD and 52 developing econ­\n",
    "omies and Caviglia-Harris ‘. (2009) on 40 selected economies found\n",
    "no significant evidence of EKC. In a recent survey of literate on ECK,\n",
    "Shahbaz and Sinha (2019) showed that the inconclusive evidence on\n",
    "EKC depends on contextual factors including the choice of explanatory\n",
    "\n",
    "variables, the time horizon of study and underlying approach to\n",
    "empirical estimation EKC relationship. Therefore, it is cogent to conduct\n",
    "an investigation, specifically focusing on the subject economies before\n",
    "drawing any inference on the growth-environment nexus.\n",
    "Parallel to economic growth, the degree of financial development\n",
    "may have an important impact on the environment (e.g., Yuan and\n",
    "Gallagher, 2018; Leimbach ‘., 2018; Campiglio, 2016). Zhang (2011)\n",
    "noted that the nexus between finance and emissions is manifested in the\n",
    "finance-led energy consumption according to which financial develop­\n",
    "ment leads to i) an increase in FDI inflows and economic growth which\n",
    "drives up energy consumption; ii) an increased usage of energy-intensive\n",
    "equipment and services, and iii) more investment which requires\n",
    "increased energy consumption. There is also a silver lining to the\n",
    "finance-environment nexus as the financial development can harbour\n",
    "new opportunities for renewable energy generation and allocation of\n",
    "finance to more innovative and efficient firms (Chang, 2015). Reconsi­\n",
    "dering the environmental effects of financial development is important\n",
    "because the evidence on the finance-environment is inconclusive (e.g.,\n",
    "Nasir ‘., 2019; Salahuddin ‘., 2018; Shahbaz ‘., 2016; Javid\n",
    "and Sharif, 2016; Charfeddine and Khediri, 2016; Omri ‘., 2015;\n",
    "Ozturk and Acaravci, 2013; Çoban and Topcu, 2013; Tamazian and Rao,\n",
    "2010; Tamazian ‘., 2009) which could be due to the different\n",
    "channels of financial development as well as their differing importance\n",
    "in the subject economies. Concomitantly, the contrasting evidence is\n",
    "intriguing and provides the rationale for further research. Nonetheless,\n",
    "it is also vital to consider various aspects of financial sector rather\n",
    "focusing on a single measure of financialisation (Nasir ‘., 2019).\n",
    "Compared to previous studies, we take a more inclusive approach to\n",
    "gauge the aspect of financial development. In so doing, we also use the\n",
    "issuance of debt and the expansion of the equity market, in addition to\n",
    "the domestic credit creation.\n",
    "The literature also pays close attention to the role of FDI inflows as\n",
    "they can affect the environmental quality through economic growth.\n",
    "This makes it a crucial factor for estimating and forecasting the GHGs as\n",
    "a result of increased economic activity. It is worth noting that the G6\n",
    "economies are major attractions for the global FDI. In theory, three di­\n",
    "mensions of the FDI-environment nexus are hypothesised as the\n",
    "pollution-haven, the pollution-halo and the scale-effect hypothesis.\n",
    "When a host country with weak regulatory environment attracts FDI\n",
    "which causes environmental degradation, the pollution-haven hypoth­\n",
    "esis (PHH) supposed to prevail (Cole and Fredriksson, 2009; Naughton,\n",
    "2014). By contrast, the pollution-halo hypothesis prevails in a scenario\n",
    "where the multinational and transnational firms bring FDI together with\n",
    "green technology as well as global environmental standards and prac­\n",

    "which in turn causes increased pollution and degradation of the envi­\n",
    "ronment (Rezza, 2013; Pao and Tsai, 2011). The empirical literature on\n",
    "the role of FDI suggests mixed and contrasting results. Studies finding\n",

    "others, Pao and Tsai (2011), Al-Mulali and Tang (2013), Liu ‘.\n",

    "market economies across the world, Argentina has been acknowledged as one such nation which has conventionally implemented\n",
    "policies to boost economic growth while overlooking the environmental deterioration which took place in tandem (Koengkan\n",
    "‘., 2020). Argentina is the largest emerging economy in Latin\n",
    "America which has traditionally globalized its economy in quest\n",
    "of expediting its economic growth rate. Consequently, although\n",
    "the nation had prospered economically, it has resulted in the aggravation of its CO2 emission figures. For instance, between 2000\n",
    "and 2018, Argentina’s annual per capita GDP and CO2 emissions\n",
    "have simultaneously surged by around 22% and 8%, respectively\n",
    "(World Bank, 2020). The rising trends concerning both these\n",
    "key macroeconomic aggregates can be credited to Argentina’s\n",
    "globalization policies which have monotonically facilitated the\n",
    "nation’s decisions to globalize its economy to expedite economic\n",
    "growth. Accordingly, the nation’s trade openness index, measured\n",
    "in terms of the percentage share of exports and imports in the\n",
    "GDP, rose by almost 8 percentage points over the 2000–2020\n",
    "period (World Bank, 2020). On the other hand, the nation’s annual\n",
    "percentage shares of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in\n",
    "the GDP have almost doubled between 2001 and 2019 (World\n",
    "Bank, 2020). Therefore, these rising trends in the shares of international trade flows and FDI inflows along with the persistently\n",
    "surging trends in Argentina’s CO2 emission levels suggest that the\n",
    "nation’s trade and financial globalization policies have not been\n",
    "environmentally friendly.\n",
    "The possible negative environmental consequences associated\n",
    "with globalization in the context of Argentina could be explained\n",
    "from the perspective that globalization, over the years, is likely\n",
    "to have boosted the overall energy demand of the nation which\n",
    "has mostly been met with fossil fuels. Almost 72% of Argentina’s\n",
    "total electricity, as illustrated in Fig. 1, is generated from nonrenewable fossil fuels. As far as the shares of different fuels\n",
    "in the total electricity output are concerned, Fig. 1 shows that\n",
    "natural gas and coal accounts for the largest and smallest shares,\n",
    "respectively. More importantly, Argentina’s traditional fossil fuel\n",
    "dependency is further highlighted from the fact that the nation generates merely 28% of its electricity output using renewable sources (mostly hydropower); moreover, between 1990 and\n",
    "2015, the renewable electricity output shares have on average\n",
    "declined by 7 percentage points. Hence, it can be said that, during\n",
    "this period, Argentina rather than moving towards a clean energy\n",
    "transition has boosted its reliance on fossil fuels for meeting its\n",
    "local energy demand. A major barrier faced by the nation in undergoing the clean energy transition was the lack of investments\n",
    "concerning the development of renewable energy technologies.\n",
    "Consequently, the nation was obliged to import hefty amounts of\n",
    "oil to manage its domestic energy demand (World Bank, 2020)\n",
    "which further reduced the nation’s renewable electricity output shares. However, recently, following the enactment of Law\n",
    "27.191, investments in renewable energy have increased as the\n",
    "Argentine government declared the national objective of boosting\n",
    "the renewable electricity shares to 20% and 25% by 2025 and\n",
    "2031, respectively. Hence, underscoring the importance of achieving these targets, it is necessary to examine whether or not such\n",
    "initiatives to promote renewable energy use, and simultaneously\n",
    "inhibiting non-renewable energy consumption as well, would be\n",
    "effective in improving environmental quality in Argentina.\n",
    "Therefore, considering the potential environmental consequences of globalization and energy use, this study investigates\n",
    "the dynamic effects of globalization and energy consumption\n",
    "on CO2 emissions in Argentina and also controls for economic\n",
    "growth within the analysis. The contributions of this current\n",
    "study to the literature are four-folds. First, although many previous studies have scrutinized the macroeconomic determinants\n",
    "of CO2 emissions using panel data sets on Latin American countries (Sheinbaum ‘., 2011; Koengkan and Fuinhas, 2020a;\n",
    "\n",
    "Adebayo ‘., 2021), a country-specific study in the context of\n",
    "Argentina is yet to be conducted. Though cross-country studies\n",
    "are important, conducting country-specific studies is pertinent to\n",
    "identify specific policies considering the country-specific properties of a certain country. Second, as opposed to the traditional\n",
    "approach of evaluating the environmental effect of aggregate energy consumption, this study isolates the impacts of consumption\n",
    "of different energy resources (renewable and non-renewable) on\n",
    "CO2 emissions in the context of Argentina. Disaggregating the\n",
    "energy consumption figure is important because it has been acknowledged in the literature that renewable and non-renewable\n",
    "energy uses exert heterogeneous impacts on CO2 emissions (Chen\n",
    "‘., 2019; Murshed, 2020).\n",
    "Third, the preceding studies have predominantly explored\n",
    "the individual impacts of globalization and renewable and nonrenewable energy use on CO2 emissions (Shahbaz ‘., 2017;\n",
    "Khan ‘., 2019); but not much is known regarding the possible joint impacts of these variables. Hence, this study interacts\n",
    "globalization with renewable and non-renewable energy consumption to explore the interactive impacts of these variables\n",
    "on Argentina’s CO2 emission figures to unearth some additional\n",
    "policy implications. Lastly, to account for the structural breaks in\n",
    "the data, the methodology used in this study is robust to handling\n",
    "this issue. It is important to control for the structural break\n",
    "within the estimation process since overlooking this critically\n",
    "important issue could lead to the estimation of biased outcomes.\n",
    "The majority of the relevant studies in the literature have not controlled for the structural break issue to model the determinants\n",
    "of CO2 emissions (Ali ‘., 2020). Hence, this study bridges this\n",
    "methodological gap in the literature by employing the Zivot and\n",
    "Andrews (1992) unit root test, Maki (2012) cointegration test,\n",
    "and the gradual shift causality test to ascertain the integrating\n",
    "and cointegrating properties and causal relationships among the\n",
    "variables, respectively. Besides, structural break dummies are also\n",
    "included in the model to control for the structural break concerns\n",
    "within the regression analysis.\n",
    "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the literature review is discussed in Section 2 while Section 3 explains\n",
    "the data and the econometric approach of the study; the study’s\n",
    "comprehensive assessments are discussed in Section 4; finally,\n",
    "Section 5 concludes with relevant policy implications.\n",
    "2. Literature review\n",
    "This section has two broad segments in which the former\n",
    "provides a brief overview of the theoretical framework of the\n",

    "2.1. Theoretical framework\n",
    "The exploration of the energy–economy–environment enigma\n",
    "has ramified over the years; thus, splitting the literature into\n",
    "three strands. The first strand of literature closely looked at\n",
    "the links between GHG emissions and economic growth through\n",
    "the lens of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis\n",
    "introduced in the study by Grossman and Krueger (1991). The\n",
    "core assumption of this theory is that an economy initially grows\n",
    "at the expense of environmental adversity; however, this tradeoff gradually decreases in the future as the economic growth in\n",
    "the latter phases facilitates environmental development (Yilanci\n",
    "and Pata, 2020). The initial negative impacts of economic growth\n",
    "on the environment can be reason from the perspective of scale\n",
    "effect and composition effects which assert that as an economy\n",

    "nations are demonstrating poor performance, compared to their developed counterpart in\n",
    "various fronts, and climate action is major among them (UNESCAP, 2021). This report\n",
    "reiterated the environmental concerns raised by the United Nations, during the assessment\n",
    "of the environmental SDGs (UNESCAP, 2020). The prevailing economic growth trajectory\n",
    "in these nations is not environmentally sustainable, as economic growth pattern of these\n",
    "nations is largely dependent on the fossil fuel-based solutions. Therefore, these nations are\n",
    "finding it difficult to recalibrate the existing policies for attaining the objective the climate\n",
    "action, which falls under SDG 13. While drawing the reference of SDG 13, the Asian economies need special mention, as these economics are considered as the laggards in terms\n",
    "of attaining the SDG objectives. In the 2019 baseline Poverty Eradication report, World\n",
    "Bank has attributed environmental degradation to be one of the major hindrances on the\n",
    "way to achieve economic development in Asia (Fallesen ‘., 2019). Given this contextual\n",
    "setting, policy reorientation is essential in the Asian countries, so as to avoid the climatic\n",
    "vulnerability of the economic growth and ensure sustainable development. The concern of\n",
    "the International Monetary Fund in this regard can be felt in the work of Prakash (2018),\n",
    "who also has stressed on the policy realignment aspect for these economies. This prevailing policy-level void gives the primary rationale for conducting the present study.\n",
    "During treading along this economic growth trajectory, these economies are experiencing a surge in the job opportunities, because of which the urban regions in these economies\n",
    "are undergoing an anthropogenic transition. This transition can be referred to as urbanization, which is caused by the demand of labor force created by the rapid industrial activities.\n",
    "This shift of the labor force toward the urban areas has catalyzed the energy demand to\n",
    "escalate, and this escalation has consequentially given rise to the rise in ambient air pollution. While describing the economic inequality prevailing in these nations, the issue of\n",
    "unsustainable urbanization has been discussed in the Human Development Report 2019,\n",
    "and the problem of rising C\n",
    "­ O2 emissions has also been attributed to the rising urbanization\n",
    "(UNDP, 2019). Now, in order to cater to the rising demand of energy in the urban areas,\n",
    "and at the same time, to protect and improve the environmental quality, these nations are\n",
    "exploring the potential of the renewable energy solutions. The latest Energy Target Assessment report of International Energy Agency has stressed on the discovery and diffusion\n",
    "of renewable energy solutions for achieving energy security and improving environmental\n",
    "quality in the Asian countries (Kristiansen and Arboleya, 2021). Now, this report has also\n",
    "mentioned about investment in the renewable energy generation systems by creating adequate financialization channels. These new financialization channels might help in boosting\n",
    "the development and deployment of domestic renewable energy systems, while the existing\n",
    "channels are more prone toward boosting the industrialization and consequential environmental degradation. The report by Asian Development Bank on Green Energy Financing in\n",
    "Asian economies has focused on this particular issue for the South Asian economies (Peimani, 2018). In such a scenario, this gives a clear indication that the existing policy framework in the Asian economies might create a predicament in achieving the energy solutions\n",

    "to attain the SDG objectives by 2030 for these economies. This particular SDG-oriented\n",
    "policy design purpose gives the second rationale of the present study.\n",

    "natural habitat started to increase. While analyzing deforestation in the South East Asian\n",
    "countries, the European Parliamentary Research Service has stressed on the community\n",
    "farming activities, and it has also been mentioned that in pursuit of achieving agricultural\n",
    "productivity, these nations have in turn started degrading the environmental quality (Russell, 2020). Therefore, in order to attain the objectives of SDG 13, the policymakers of\n",
    "these nations need to look into the pattern of agricultural activities, so that the negative\n",
    "environmental externalities exerted by these activities can be internalized through the\n",
    "policy redesign. This agriculture-focused climatic policy design purpose gives the third\n",
    "rationale of the present study.\n",
    "Given this persisting policy-level problem in the Asian economies, it becomes imperative how to realign the existing policies in these nations for attaining the SDG objectives\n",

    "3 Empirical framework\n",
    "3.1 Theoretical underpinning\n",
    "As the fossil fuel-based energy is a key stimulus to economic growth in the Asian economies, the prevailing energy consumption pattern exerts a negative environmental externality\n",
    "in these economies. Now, the rising economic growth in these economies has resulted in a\n",
    "rise in the job opportunities. Hence, in anticipation of a better living standard, urban centers of\n",
    "these economies have experienced a rise in the migration of population from the rural areas.\n",
    "This gradual rise in the urban population has exerted a pressure on the urban infrastructure.\n",
    "With the rise in urban population, though overall income level rises, living standard increases\n",
    "disproportionately, as difference between skilled and unskilled labors enhances the income\n",
    "inequality. Consequently, the slums and shadow cities start forming, and the people living in\n",
    "these areas largely lack the access to clean cooking fuels. Hence, the level of emission rises in\n",
    "the urban centers and the peripheral areas. However, the overall rise in income gives rise to the\n",
    "demand of durables and consumables, which in turn is translated into rise in the level of agricultural and manufacturing production. Now, in order to boost these two production activities,\n",
    "the respective governments in these nations need to mobilize the finances, so that these sectors\n",
    "can have more access to the factors of production. In order to boost the agricultural activities,\n",
    "demand for arable lands largely results in deforestation activities, which subsequently affects\n",
    "the internalization of negative environmental externalities. On the other hands, as the Asian\n",
    "economies are largely dependent on energy-intensive industries, rise in the production level\n",
    "causes rise in the level of emissions. With a view to address this issue of rising emission levels\n",

    "and to comply with the objectives of Agenda 2030, policymakers start emphasizing on the\n",

    "energy generation technologies across the nations might start coopting the adverse ecological\n",
    "externalities wielded by the prevailing economic growth trajectory. Therefore, encountering\n",
    "the environmental degradation issue in these nations needs the formulation of a policy framework encompassing these impacts.\n",
    "Taking a cue from this brief discussion, an assumption can be made that the course of\n",
    "economic growth in the Asian countries is wielding an ecological pressure by creating ambient air pollution. Hence, it can be said that the economic growth and its potential drivers are\n",

    "As the beginning point of the analysis, two diagnostic tests are conducted. First, the possibility of multicollinearity in the data is checked. This is necessary to understand whether\n",
    "the long-run coefficients will be spurious, or not. The results of multicollinearity check\n",
    "reported in \"Appendix 1\" show that the variables are free from multicollinearity. Second,\n",
    "once it is affirmed that the data are free from multicollinearity issues, the methodological\n",
    "selection needs to be confirmed. In this quest, possibility of the cross-sectional dependence in the model parameters is checked. This checking is necessary to decide on whether\n",
    "the methodological approach should be first or second generation in nature. The cross-sectional dependence test results reported in \"Appendix\" 2 show that the variables are not\n",
    "cross-sectionally dependent. Hence, in the empirical pursuit, the first-generation methods\n",
    "can be applied.\n",
    "To start with, Levin ‘. (2002) panel unit-root test is applied. The findings reported\n",
    "in Table 1 show that the variables are first order integrated. For assessing robustness of the\n",
    "LLC test outcomes, the Breitung (2002) unit-root test is employed. This test confirms the\n",
    "stationarity properties of the variables. Once it is affirmed that the variables are first order\n",
    "integrated, i.e., they are stationary after the first differentiation, testing for the cointegration\n",
    "among the variables is sanctioned.\n",

    "‘. (2015), Sharif ‘. (2019), Sinha ‘. (2019a), and Zafar ‘. (2021). Now, it\n",
    "can be assumed that economic growth cannot automatically exert negative environmental\n",
    "externality. Therefore, in order to understand the dynamics of this externality, the impacts\n",
    "of the economic growth drivers on carbon dioxide emissions need to be analyzed. These\n",
    "nations are recognized by their high growth prospect, and economic expansion requires\n",
    "financial mobilization. The financialization toward the expansion of production processes\n",
    "adds to the economic growth. As majority of this production processes are labor-intensive\n",
    "in nature, so it can be expected that these processes will be less energy efficient. Hence,\n",
    "by means of the expansion of production processes, financialization might exert negative\n",
    "environmental externality in these nations. This very argument can be validated against the\n",
    "expansionary influence of financial development on carbon dioxide emissions. This piece\n",
    "of the empirical evidence resonates with the results of Ali ‘. (2015), Al-Mulali ‘.\n",
    "(2015), and Boutabba (2014). With the economic expansion, job opportunities start rising. As the industrial development in these nations is majorly concentrated in the urban\n",
    "and semi-urban areas, so the job opportunities are also concentrated in these regions only.\n",
    "Rise in the job opportunities in turn increases the expectation of a better livelihood, as the\n",
    "overall level of income will also rise. This expectation will start attracting the people from\n",
    "the rural areas toward the urban centers, and these nations will start experiencing a rise in\n",
    "the urban population. Now, as the job opportunities will be divided by the level of skill set,\n",
    "the urban population will be eventually segregated in to skilled and unskilled labors. This\n",
    "segregation might consequently increase the economic and social divides, and as a result,\n",
    "the urban centers will experience the formation of slum areas and shadow cities. The people residing in these areas lack the access to clean cooking fuels, and this unsustainable\n",
    "energy usage pattern in turn increases the level of carbon dioxide emissions. This argument\n",
    "can be validated by the expansionary impact of urbanization on carbon dioxide emissions.\n",
    "This part of the empirical outcomes is comparable with the works of Pata (2018), Liddle\n",
    "(2014), Shahbaz ‘. (2014), and Alam ‘. (2007). Now, with the rise in the overall\n",
    "level of income, the demand of durables and consumables will rise. While the expansion of\n",
    "production activities might be commensurate to the demand of durables, expansion of agricultural activities will be required to fulfill the demand of consumables. In order to expand\n",
    "the agricultural activities, more arable lands will be required. For this purpose, deforestation will take place through the channel of deforestation, expansion of agricultural activities will exert and environmental pressure. Validation of this argument is reflected in the\n",
    "expansionary impact of agricultural productivity on carbon dioxide emissions. Although\n",
    "insignificant, this impact can be a serious concern for the policymakers.\n",
    "Study outcomes reveal that the course of economic growth in these nations is environmentally unsustainable, and a major reason behind this is their reliance on the nonrenewable energy. This particular issue can be compared with the seminal work on the “Limits\n",
    "to Growth,” initiated by the economists of Club of Rome (Meadows ‘., 1972). Taking a cue from this discussion, it can be assumed that the basis of developmental course\n",
    "might be harmed by prolonged reliance on nonrenewable energy. Hence, the policymakers\n",
    "need to embark on initiating energy transition. Development and deployment of renewable\n",
    "energy solutions are a major component of this initiative. Gradually rising dependence on\n",
    "the renewable energy solutions can not only support these nations to diminish the level of\n",
    "emissions, but also can support in solving the issue of energy security. A substantiation\n",
    "of this argument can be reflected in the contractionary impact of renewable energy consumption on carbon dioxide emissions. This piece of the empirical evidence resonates with\n",

    "energy consumption, financial development, economic growth, and agricultural productivity on C\n",
    "­ O2 emissions in selected 15 Asian economies for the period 1990–2014. Based\n",
    "on the long-run coefficient estimation results, it can be concluded that urbanization, financial development, and economic growth are responsible for environmental degradation in\n",
    "the long-run. On the contrary, renewable energy consumption is reducing environmental\n",
    "degradation. Moreover, agriculture has a positive but statistically insignificant influence on\n",
    "­CO2 emissions.\n",

    "5.2 Policy framework\n",
    "Prolonged reliance on nonrenewable might deter the overnight replacement of these\n",
    "solutions, as it might create hindrance in the economic growth pattern. Therefore, these\n",
    "policy instruments need to be calibrated in a way so that the problem of environmental\n",
    "degradation can be handled, and these economies move forward toward realizing the\n",

    "demand from the centers is inevitable. In order to cater to the surplus energy demand\n",
    "arising from the households, the policymakers might take a phase-wise implementation\n",
    "schedule. In the first schedule, the policymakers might consider subsidizing the renewable energy solutions for the households. As this move will have certain negative financial implications, a complimentary move needs to be taken by considering the industrial\n",
    "players. Along with the households, the industrial players will also be able to avail the\n",
    "renewable energy solutions for a predefined rate prescribed by policymakers, while the\n",
    "price charged from the industrial players will be higher compared to the one provided to\n",
    "the households. Now, the financial institutions might be given instructions to disburse\n",
    "credits to firms for availing these solutions against discriminatory interest rates, depending on the carbon footprint of those players. Carbon footprint of the industrial players\n",
    "can be assessed, and based on the level of carbon footprint, the rate of interest will vary,\n",
    "i.e., higher carbon footprint will attract higher rate of interest. In that way, the industrial\n",
    "players will gradually be discouraged to consume the fossil fuel solutions, as the policy\n",
    "mandates will be focused at promoting the cleaner energy solutions. Gradual rise in the\n",
    "renewable energy demand will be having scale effect on the renewable energy generation, which in turn will start reducing the price of the solutions (Sinha ‘., 2020a, b).\n",
    "This policy will help these nations to achieve not only cleaner energy solutions, but also\n",
    "a secured energy future. This might support them to move forward on the way to realize\n",
    "the objective of SDG 7.\n",
    "While securing the energy future the policymakers also need to make the agricultural\n",
    "activities mode sustainable by reducing the level of deforestation. If certain areas of forest need to be removed for the agricultural activities, policymakers need to ensure that\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "This paper examined the nexus between economic growth, energy consumption, urbanization, population growth, and carbon\n",
    "emissions in the BRICS economies from 1990 to 2019. In order to yield valid and reliable outcomes, modern econometric\n",
    "techniques that are vigorous to cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity were employed. From the findings,\n",
    "the studied panel was heterogeneous and cross-sectionally dependent. Also, all the series were first differenced stationary\n",
    "and co-integrated in the long run. The Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group\n",
    "(CCEMG) estimators were employed to estimate the elastic effects of the predictors on the explained variable, and from\n",
    "the output of both estimators, energy consumption worsened environmental quality via high carbon emissions. Also, the\n",
    "AMG estimator affirmed economic growth to be a significantly positive determinant of carbon emissions. However, both\n",
    "estimators confirmed urbanization and population growth as trivial predictors of the emissivities of carbon. On the causal\n",
    "connections amidst the series, there was bidirectional causality between economic growth and carbon emissions, between\n",
    "energy consumption and economic growth, between economic growth and population growth, between energy consumption\n",
    "and urbanization, and between economic growth and urbanization. Lastly, a causation from urbanization to carbon emissions\n",
    "was unfolded. Policy implications are further discussed.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Global attention has always been drawn to environmental\n",
    "protection issues. Carbon dioxide ­(CO2) emission prevention\n",
    "is one of the most effective steps in environmental sustainability. Since the Industrial Revolution, the combustion of\n",
    "fossil fuels has generated a rapid increase in global ­CO2\n",
    "emissions, leading to global warming (Musah ‘. 2021d).\n",
    "With the depletion of resources and the disadvantages of\n",
    "conventional energy usage continuing to emerge, logical and\n",
    "efficient energy use has become a vital aspect of a nation’s\n",
    "sustainable development (Musah ‘. 2021a). Literature\n",
    "has shown that energy use increases as economic activities\n",

    "depletes due to the emissions of ­CO2 from these economic\n",
    "activities (Musah ‘. 2021c). According to Raghutla and\n",
    "Chittedi (2020), increased economic growth necessitates\n",
    "more output, while energy consuming activities must fulfill the greatest number of human desires, resulting in more\n",
    "pollution and waste while putting a strain on environmental\n",
    "and natural resources. Greater economic activities necessitate more energy supply; in 2010, emerging economies\n",
    "consumed 16% more energy than developed economies,\n",
    "and emerging economies are expected to consume 88%\n",
    "more energy than developed economies by 2040 (Paramati\n",

    "Kasperowicz (2015) discovered an inverse relationship amid\n",
    "economic growth and ­CO2 secretions. This means that economic growth and ­CO2 secretions go in opposing directions\n",
    "since a boost in one does not cause a rise in the other. Similarly, Ozcan (2013) discovered that ­CO2 emissions decline\n",
    "when real economic growth per capita rises. The grounds for\n",

    "Urbanization, linked to abiotic deterioration of the\n",

    "another driver of ­CO2 emissions (Li ‘. 2021b; Musah\n",
    "‘. 2021a). Musah ‘. (2021a) posited that as the population goes up, society puts strain on finite resources for\n",
    "existence. Nevertheless, the influence on the climate via\n",
    "urbanization is conflicting. Mahmood ‘. (2020) suggested that urbanization might limit environmental deterioration through resource efficiency and environmental\n",
    "quality enhancement. A research carried out showed an\n",
    "adverse correlation between urbanization and environmental degradation (Dadon 2019). The world’s urban population is estimated to reach 4.6 billion by 2030 (Mensah\n",
    "‘. 2021). As a result, it is normal to anticipate that\n",
    "urbanized areas would be stimulated by strong economic\n",
    "trend sources such as construction, production, and transportation, fueled mostly by fossil fuels, resulting in environmental deterioration. As a result, incorporating urbanization into this study is critical. Another factor influencing\n",
    "­CO2 emissions is population increase. Some studies have\n",

    "Discussion of the results\n",
    "The AMG and CCEMG estimators determined the longterm balanced connection between the series. According to\n",
    "the AMG estimator, lnGDP substantially influenced ­lnCO2\n",
    "emanations in the BRICS nations. lnGDP’s significant\n",
    "positive influence on l­nCO2 emissions suggests that a 1%\n",
    "growth in lnGDP will result in ­lnCO2 emissions increased\n",
    "by 0.01926%. This study has significant conclusions; higher\n",
    "rates of growth can lead to C\n",
    "­ O2 emissions. However, the\n",
    "result differs in the CCEMG estimator, where lnGDP positively influenced l­ nCO2 emanation but was statistically irrelevant. The result in the AMG estimator indicates that an\n",
    "upsurge in GDP resulted in an upsurge in performance of\n",
    "the principal factors of production in the country, including\n",
    "labor, capital, and land. The operations of these economic\n",
    "undertakings rely heavily on the use of large volumes of pollutant energy that increases C\n",
    "­ O2 emissions. The findings collaborate with past research of Islam ‘. (2021), Muhammad (2019), and Nosheen ‘. (2021) that found GDP as\n",
    "a driver of ­CO2 emissions. The result opposes Sheraz ‘.\n",
    "(2021), Bosah ‘. (2021), and Shoaib ‘. (2020), who\n",
    "postulated GDP as a material opposing driver of C\n",
    "­ O2 emanations in the long run.\n",
    "lnEC has a material positive impact on l­ nCO2 emissions;\n",
    "therefore, a unit upsurge in lnEC will escalate ­lnCO2 emissions by 0.3516% and 0.31094%, correspondingly, based on\n",
    "AMG and CCEMG estimators. This result is not surprising,\n",
    "as most BRICS countries are enclosed with many businesses\n",
    "that largely rely on high polluting energy sources to promote\n",
    "their activities. This conclusion shows that economic activity in BRICS countries, in general, is linked to the use of\n",
    "huge quantities of unfavorable energy sources, mainly fossil\n",
    "\n",
    "13\n",
    "\n",
    "fuels, coal, natural gas, etc. These sources of energy increase\n",
    "the country’s emission rate. In short, a rise in the processing of goods and services is linked with the consumption of\n",
    "large quantities of fossil fuels which increases the degree of\n",
    "secretions of ­CO2 in the countries. The finding is congruent with Ali ‘. (2016), Musah ‘. (2021e), and Musah\n",
    "‘. (2021b), who found EC as a significant driver of ­CO2\n",
    "emissions. However, our outcome contradicts Zafar ‘.\n",
    "(2019), who revealed that EC does not influence C\n",
    "­ O2 emissions, and Sun ‘. (2021) discovered an inverse linkage\n",
    "between EC and ­CO2 emissions, signifying that increasing\n",
    "energy consumption reduces ­CO2 emissions.\n",
    "According to both AMG and CCEMG, lnUR had an\n",
    "immaterial influence on ­lnCO2 emissions in BRICS nations.\n",
    "The irrelevant outcome of lnUR on ­lnCO2 indicates that an\n",
    "upsurge in lnUR has no major influence on BRICS countries’ ­lnCO2 emissions. This finding shows that people\n",
    "moving to cities, which leads to increased industrialization,\n",

    "Conclusion and policy recommendations\n",
    "From 1990 through 2019, this study looked at the relationship between BRICS countries’ GDP, EC, PP, UR, and\n",
    "­CO2 emissions. For the analysis, more sophisticated panel\n",
    "estimate approaches were applied to uncover reliable and\n",
    "valid results. A preliminary check was performed to see if\n",
    "the variables could be utilized together. The test revealed\n",
    "that the study model had no issues with multi-collinearity.\n",
    "According to the heterogeneity and cross-sectional tests\n",
    "findings, the study’s panels were heterogeneous and crosssectionally based. Also, all of the series achieved stationarity\n",
    "at the first distinction. Furthermore, Westerlund and Edgerton’s panel co-integration test discovered that the covariates\n",
    "under consideration were co-integrated in the long run. The\n",
    "AMG and CCEMG estimators were utilized to evaluate the\n",
    "long-run balanced connection between the series. According to the AMG estimator, lnGDP and lnEC substantially\n",
    "and positively influenced ­lnCO2 emissions. Furthermore, the\n",
    "AMG estimator showed that lnUR and lnPP are insignificant\n",
    "predictors of l­ nCO2 emissions in BRICS nations. According\n",
    "to the CCEMG estimate, lnEC forecasted ­lnCO2 emissions\n",
    "in the BRICS nations positively and significantly. However,\n",
    "lnGDP, lnUR, and lnPP did not influence l­ nCO2 emissions.\n",
    "Last, the Dumitrescu–Hurlin test was used to assess the\n",
    "causative linkages in the series, and the outcomes demonstrated a double-headed causality in the panel among lnGDP\n",
    "and ­lnCO2, lnGDP and lnEC, lnGDP and lnUR, lnGDP and\n",

    "There was one-way causation from l­nCO2 emanations to\n",

    "to ­lnCO2 emissions. Finally, one-way causation was established from ­lnCO2 emissions to lnPP. The methods used in\n",
    "this study show that the results are accurate in drafting some\n",

    "energy sources like solar, wind, biogas, biomass, and\n",
    "hydropower. These sustainable energy sources will not\n",
    "only reduce ­CO2 emissions but will also help countries\n",
    "prosper economically.\n",
    "Furthermore, policies that relate to the environment\n",
    "should be adequately planned, structured, and employed\n",
    "following the country’s macroeconomic goals. Once\n",
    "this is realized, energy conservation programs aimed at\n",
    "reducing ­CO2 emissions will help nations flourish economically.\n",
    "Because urbanization contributes to ­CO2 emissions,\n",
    "authorities must strive to create jobs and raising rural\n",
    "people’s living conditions. Individuals will move from\n",
    "rural to urban zones at a slower rate as a result of this.\n",
    "Furthermore, giving social facilities to rural areas will\n",
    "aid in reducing the rate of urbanization, hence lowering\n",

    "that increased energy use causes environmental damage, waste, and\n",

    "as energy source because it generates less pollutants than coal [19].\n",
    "According to a study that was conducted recently it was found that\n",
